Agent,"Thanks! Okay got it, how soon do you need to move?",,,,,
Lead,I need to move mid to late May. My lease ends May 31,,,,"January 21, 2025",Moving in about 4 months - Lead being in a current lease slighly indicates they are qualified. Still need to verify what apartment criteria they are wanting

Lead,the budget is a strict max as of now,,,,,

Agent,"Okay got it. For insight, availability will only show as far out as about mid/late March right now, until 60 day notices come in from current renters for later dates. And we won’t want to tour so early because you’d miss out on look and lease specials (applying within 48 hours of touring) if you tour soon and re-tour closer to your move date. Just keep these things in mind. I’ll send a quick list shortly and then a final list of deals when we’re about 60 days from your move date. We’ll aim to start touring late March/early April """,,,,,Best time to start an apartment search is about 60 days from moving. Most apartments in Texas require 60 day notice from renters to vacate. When 60 day notices are submitted is when a renters apartment will go back on the market for everyone to see.

The Sylvan in the Woodlands – one bedroom townhome with attached garage is $1875 + one month free. One bedroom with attached garage is $1700 + one month free",,,,,Send more options (Human activity). Specific mention of apartment details is also a human activity
Lead,"Hey Ashanti!

Thanks for sending these over, they're very nice and meet a lot of my preferences. The only issue is there doesn't seem to be any street view. (this was the phrase I was looking for when I when we spoke about my private balcony preference) units available.

I'll have to check if there's some available for the other Apartments I starred in the portal I think having a street view or not will be a deciding factor

Also, the Cypress apartments may be too close to the areas. I'm trying to avoid if there's North Cypress like going toward tumble I'd be interested.

I went ahead and favored them anyway, but I want to be mindful of your time and gas mileage when we're touring them and they don't end up having an ideal unit for me.

What are your thoughts? Happy to hear them!",,,,,Lead asks for thoughts and opinion on specific apartment related details - should be escalated to a human.
Agent,"Okay! Street view, I see!

I see you didn't favorite cottage living. Some of those have fenced backyards. Any interest there?

And do you want the street or just to not be facing others?",,,,,Sharing thoughts and opinion on specific apartment related details -  human activity
Lead,"Yeah doesn't have to be straight. Just not facing others or typical gathering areas like the pool. Outside view is a better way to put it.

Not much interest in cottage living, but I did see Kingwood residences had a few units with an outside view.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay I got it, I'll run a final search today and see what all options we can set up for your visit!",,,Human needs to run a search,,
Lead,Sounds good thank you!,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is mine!,,,,,

There's been a change of plans and I won't be able to make it to Houston next week.

However I am still very much in the hunt for a new place and I appreciate all of your help so far and would like to continue our partnership. 

It's looking like the week of April 20th or April 27th is when I'll be in Houston. I'll know closer to then before I can confirm.

As for move in dates I'll be open to pushing it back to June or later as opposed to mid may. That should give us some time for touring and whatnot.

Let me know your thoughts. Happy to hop on a call to discuss the change in plans!",,,,"April 1, 2025",

I went ahead and applied not too long ago to secure the unit for an August move in. 

I appreciate your assistance with all of this. Are there any next steps on our end?",,,Lead has applied,,"Logic for when a Lead applies and I get credit: if I am present the whole way and schedule tours for them then I should get credit from the apartment. Ideally, I want the Lead to list me on the application as their referral. "
Agent,"Hey Tee, that's perfect! I'm glad we found the right one. 

No next steps, just please keep me in the loop and let me know when you've been approved.

Lead,"Hi! And sounds good — I’m not sure if you saw but I rescheduled the Grove East one to 12 PM if that’s ok? If we can’t fit all 5 into the time we’re there it’s okay! Our top 3 would be Grove East, San Palmas, and Evolve Champions.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, got it no problem. So far we have...

Grove East - 12 PM (Thu)
San Palmas - 2 PM (Thu) 
Meridian City Park - 10 AM (Fri)

I’ll prioritize getting Evolve Champions scheduled and let you know when all set!",,,,,Only human knows these tour details at this point

Agent,Hey Daniella! What are your thoughts on all you’ve seen? Is San Palmas looking like the one?,,,,,

Agent,Niceee! That’s great! Please be on the lookout for the Locator referral on the application — that’s how the building credits me. I’ll be here if you need anything at all!,,,,"April 26, 2025",

Agent," Hey Ivy, it's Ashanti from IG! Just so I send options for the rightmove dates, when exactly do you need to be moved in by?",,,,,
Lead,July 1st,,,,,
Agent,"Got it. Is there anything else you want to share that you really want with your new place? feet preferences, pet, friendly, specific amenities, etc.?",,,,,
Lead,I don't have any pets. Something around 600+ square feet pool and gym. It can be one bedroom or two bedroom no studio.,,,,,
Agent,Got it! What email should I send option options to?,,,,,
Lead,ivy12@live.com,,,Ready to send a list,,Asking for only email usually means I already have full name and I'm texting her so I already have her number

Agent,"Just emailed your list. Check spam if you don't see it.

Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of of the properties require your locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏼

Lead,Yes,,,,,
Lead,I can do anytime before 3 PM,,,Time to schedule tours,,
Agent,"Okay, I'll get you scheduled",,,,,
Agent,"One more I think might be worth a look is Lenox Oaks - $1555 (25 mins from Hobby)

And then Pearl marketplace - you'll be in the area, across the street from Pearl Midtown. They only have Jr floor plans in price range though (over 600 ft.² but more like a studio with a separate bedroom)",,,,,"She mentioned on Instagram she wanted to be close to Hobby

I clarified what a Jr was because she said she didn't want a studio and wanted over 600 square feet so this option might work for her because it's not a true studio and has a seperate bedroom"
Lead,I'll look at them,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I'll follow up with your full schedule",,,,,
Agent,What is your last name?,,,,,
Lead,Bladon,,,Time to schedule tours,,
Agent,"I also just realized you have Pearl Midtown but it’s not actually Pearl Midtown prices you’re seeing. They do this weird thing where they have prices for 3 different properties on one website (pearl midtown, Pearl at the mix, 2222 Smith street). They’re all within a block of each other.

You’ll actually be seeing Pearl at the Mix. Also considered a studio but has a separate bedroom (655 sqft | $1394). Slightly newer that Pearl Midtown also which is good. Just wanted to clear things so you aren’t confused when visiting!",,,,,
Lead,That's weird lol thanks for the insight,,,,,
Lead,Are they all under the same management?,,,,,
Agent,"Lol yes very weird. And yes, same management.",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Ivy, here’s your schedule for tomorrow. Let me know
if you have any questions!

Agent,Good morning Ivy! How were your tours yesterday? Did any of them feel like the right fit?,,,,,
Lead,really well.. i'm going to put in an application for Pearl at the Mix. i really like that one,,,Lead will apply,,
Agent,"That’s great! I’m really happy to hear you found the one.
I’ll be here to help however I can. Please look out for the
referral section on the application, and choose “Locator
Service” when asked. That’s how the building credits me
for us working together 🙏🏼

Please let me know when you’ve been approved and if
there’s anything I can do at all to help!",,,,,

,"Hey Vanessa, it's Ashanti from IG! I'll send some options in a bit. Just so I can gauge the level of urgency you need to have, are you open to moving at any time for the right deal, or are you set on moving after summer?",,,,"May 5, 2025",
Lead,Hey Ashanti! And my lease ends 7/31 so at least not before then,,,,,
Agent,"OK, got it. I'll send you some options tonight. Bear with me though. I'm away from my computer so it could be late.",,,Lead needs list,,
Lead,"OK, that's cool, thanks",,,,,
Agent,Don't mention it!,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning Vanessa! I emailed your list last night. I didn’t want to text so late
 
Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

I spread the areas out a bit since not many new apartments have been built in Briar forest recently. My favorite in the area to stay under budget will probably be Remy on the trails. 

Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up for when most convenient for you. ",,,Sent List,,
Lead,"Hey good morning, thanks for the list! I’m going to check them out in more detail I’ve actually been to Remy on the trail to visit a friend. I’m currently living in Katy and wanting to move somewhen in between Katy and the loop. Where I’d be about 20 min from work (in Katy) and 20 min from the city. Would that be considered Briar Forest? Or are there other areas that would be good and have fairly new apartments?",,,,,Lead asking area/apartment specific questions - Should be escalated to a human
Agent,"Happy to help! Okay great… that makes sense. Yes that would be Memorial/Briar forest/Energy Corridor. Not so many apartments have been built in these areas in the past few years. Mainly further toward Katy or closer toward the city. Depending on how close to the city you’re willing to be, I’d also look into The Briarly. It’s right outside of Uptown, you’d be looking at a 35 min drive to and from work depending on the location. 

Other areas would favor one direction pretty heavily, Katy or the City. Like Mission Bend or Jersey Village but it just seems like it would be more convenient that you stay along Katy Fwy, correct me if I’m wrong ",,,,,Human knowledge
Lead,Yes you’re right. I don’t want to be to prone to the Houston traffic ,,,,,
Agent,Definitely understandable. How soon do you want to start touring? My suggestion is the end of this month when all 60 day notices are in from current renters for the end of July,,,,,
Lead,Ok beginning of June would work for me,,,,,Tour time frame should be noted
Agent,Okay sounds good. I’ll run another search toward the end of this month and we can start to solidify your options for tours beginning of June ,,,SHould note and schedule follow up,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti  sorry for messaging after hours. I learned that I’d need to let my current place know before the end of the month if I’m going to renew otherwise the month to month price is going to be significantly higher.  I’d like to view the one apt that I’m interested in this weekend if possible.

www.carolineatmemorial.com/",,,,,
Agent,"Hey good morning Vanessa, that’s no problem. I’ll get you scheduled for Saturday",,,Need tours scheduled,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Agent,You’re all scheduled for Saturday at 11am. Let me know if you have any questions!,,,Tours scheduled,,
Lead,"Got it, thanks ",,,,,
Agent,Happy to help,,,,,
Agent,Good morning Vanessa ☀️good luck touring today! If you need anything at all or have questions please don’t hesitate to call/text me. Can’t wait to hear how it goes!,,,,,
Lead,Good morning. Thank you I’ll let you know how it goes ,,,,,
Agent,Good afternoon. How was your tour at The Caroline on Saturday. Did it feel like the one or will we still be looking?,,,,,
Lead,Hey I was just looking at the quotes/videos from there and I wasn’t sold on it ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay no worries, we can go back to the drawing board. 

How deep into Katy is your job location? ",,,,,
Lead,"I could probably look at one more, I did like the proximity the Caroline was from the city and work, but it was kinda out the way from grocery stores and frequently traveled places ",,,,,
Lead,It’s right by here ,,,,,
Lead,Enclave at Mason Creek,,,,,
Agent,"There’s a brand new apartment called Memorial at Six that’s like a mile from Caroline that would be worth a look. There’s also San Estrella. 

And then closer to Katy there’s:
- Lenox Katy Creek
- Resia Ten Oaks

You also have Remy on the Trails which you mentioned you had a friend that lives there. They have a unit at $1598 but nothing showing right now for late July",,,,,
Lead,"Does this apt look like one you’ve seen before?

*Lead sends link to TikTok post",,,Escalate to human,,
Agent,Those are Lenox Katy Creek,,,,,
Agent,"It’s a stretch to say “only 20 mins from downtown”, sorry. But about 27 mins with absolutely no traffic. Care to see them, or is it still too far from the city for you? ",,,,,Referencing the Tiktok video saying that the apartment is only 20 minutes from downtown
Lead,The lies lol and no it is kind of far ,,,,,
Agent,"Lol precisely. Okay. How about The Briarly? They’re brand new just outside of uptown under $1600

thebriarly.com",,,,"May 21, 2025",
Agent,"Hey Vanessa, any thoughts on The Briarly? Would location work for you?",,,,"May 22, 2025",
Lead,Hey sorry for the delay. I didn’t really like that one. I’m looking at the commute time now and it would be pretty long ,,,,,
Agent,"No problem. Okay, there should be more 60 day notices submitted over the next few days so I’ll keep my eyes open and let you know what pops up. The couple right now I could recommend are San Estrella and Remy on the trails. I know you mentioned your friend living at Remy, any interest in them?",,,,,Most apartments require a 60 day notice to be submitted by current renters. When notice is submitted is when an apartment goes back on the market for all to see.
Lead,"No, the thing is they’re all small in comparison to my current place for the same price. So I’m not  seeing anything that’s worth the move ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, what apt is it that you’re at now if you don’t mind me asking?",,,,,Knowing where she lives gives more context into what she likes
Lead,Lenox grand west,,,,,Great info for human to know who is runniing searches for lead. Will help with next search and probably need to know this info asap
Lead,I have both the standing shower and tub and it’s pretty spacious so it’s hard to find something that gives me the desire to compromise,,,,,
Agent,Got it. Understood. When I come across anything comparable closer to the city I’ll send it your way,,,,,
Lead,Thanks I appreciate it,,,,,
Agent,Happy to help,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Vanessa, just wanted to reach out and update you. I was hoping to find something in the area you want, not much has been built in the last few years unfortunately. Have you already decided to renew?",,,,,
Lead,Hey yeah I put my search on hold I wasn’t seeing anything worth packing up and moving for either. So I haven’t put in my renewal yet but I plan to. Do you know any tips for negotiating a renewal offer or are they usually set in stone?,,,,,Lead asks for specific apartment related tips on negotiation. Escalate to a human
Agent,*Sent voice message,,,,,
Lead,Cool thanks! I’ll try that out and let you know how it goes. I appreciate all your help again ,,,,,
Agent,"Of course! Sounds good, I’m happy to help!",,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Lillian, it’s Ashanti from IG! Just so I send options for the right move dates, when exactly do you need to be moved in by?",,,,,I have received some qualifying info already on instagram
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, There's no specific dates I need to be moved in by but I was hoping for end of May, or mid June.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay got it. And for areas in Richmond or Sugarland, is there any address in particular you’re looking to stay close to? ",,,,,
Lead,I'm hoping to stay within 20-30 minutes of Rosenberg ,,,,,
Agent,"Got it, are there any other details you’d like to share that you want/need? Specific amenities, pet friendly, etc?",,,,,
Lead,"Pet friendly, and I would like there to be a pool, it's not a necessity though.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, no problem. Are there any requirements you see here that could possibly prevent you from being approved? 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aYe81pQDDpU7yHkrjVp4bzokCnSzDxEFSOjnGwws_7Q/edit?usp=sharing",,,,,Google doc is sent as a photo
Lead,"So I am going to be purchasing with no credit, because I am 18. Which in my area isn't that bad as long as you can prove you make three times the rent amount. But that is the only one that I think would slow the process.",,,,,
Agent,"Got it, thanks for the info. And just to confirm, you’re looking for a studio under $2k? I’d be sending 1 bedrooms as well if that’s okay",,,,,
Lead,"That's good, thank you so much for your help I really appreciate it!!",,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is all mine! ,,,,,
Agent,What email can I send your option to?,,,,,
Lead,lilliskro@gmail.com,,,Lead needs list,,
Agent,"Just emailed your list
 
Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

Lead,Okay I'll be sure to let you know by Thursday evening I have a very packed schedule for the next day and a half.,,,,,
Agent,"That sounds perfect, I'll talk to you by Thursday!",,,,,
Lead,Okay!,,,,,
Lead,"I'm not sure if the website is just slow, but if I select a favorite can you see it?",,,,,
Lead,I've been starring some but its so slow.,,,,,She is referring to favoriting apartments on our internal portal
Agent,"Yes, I can see it on my end. Sorry, it’s been acting a little slow for me too. I’ll let the tech team know",,,,,
Lead,You're good! I'll make sure everything is finalized by tomorrow!,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good!,,,,,
Lead,Okay I starred everything I could but the website was being real slow!,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I only got Granary Flats, Territory at Williams Way, and Wildwood. Is that right?",,,,,
Lead,Yes!!,,,,,
Agent,"Okay great! Can I make a few suggestions that will be similar priced or cheaper and even newer than some of the options you chose? 

The Ryon, West end, and Silos Harvest Green are all a similar distance to Rosenberg. All $1400’s or less and running specials of up to 3 months free + no application or admin fee and no deposit with approved credit (The Ryon in particular). 

Just my suggestion to add these since you’ll already be in the area. Totally up to you!",,,,,
Lead,Oh I thought I did Silos harvest!,,,,,
Lead,And the west end is nice as well!,,,,,
Agent,No worries! I just added those two. I can add The Ryon as well. Not sure how you feel about size but they have a 930 square-foot unit in the $1400s.,,,,,
Lead,Hmm I'm not sure about that one. But thank you!,,,,,
Lead,I just rechecked the Wildwood as well.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, no worries! I’ll get the 5 scheduled 

Granary Flats
Territory at Williams Way
Wildwood
Silos harvest
West end

Will Saturday work best for you to tour?",,,,,
Lead, I'm working the weekend ,,,,,
Lead,Can we do sometime next week?,,,,,
Agent,Sure thing. What day is best?,,,,,
Lead,Let me check,,,,,
Lead,"It might take me a second, I'm  scheduled weirdly for the next week and a half and I'm also going through the process of purchasing a new car.",,,,,
Lead,Let me get  back to you ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, no worries. Let me know when you’ve decided and I’ll get you scheduled! ",,,,,
Lead,Will do!,,,,,
Lead,So how does Thursday sound? I was wondering if we could focus on the apartments located in Rosenberg at first. If that's possible.,,,,,
Agent,"That's perfect. And no problem. All 5 Thursday, starting will all the Rosenberg properties?",,,,,
Lead,Give me one second to verify everything ,,,,,
Lead,"Yes yes, Thursday to do all the Rosenberg properties if that's alright and then see where we are midday ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll follow up with the full schedule early in the week!",,,Time to schedule tours,,
Lead,Okay thank you!,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is mine!,,,,,
Lead,These appointments are for the ones located in Rosenberg right ,,,,,
Agent,"All 5 will be Thursday. The ones located in Rosenberg will be first (West End, Wildwood, Territory at Williams Way). That’s good right?",,,,,
Lead,What time was the very first one?,,,,,

11 AM – the Wildwood
12 PM – West End 
1 PM – Silos harvest green
2 PM – Granery Flats 

10am at Territory hasn’t been confirmed yet. All the others have 👍🏼",,,,,
Lead,Do I owe you money straight after the tours or do you only get the funds when I purchase?,,,,,
Agent,"Oh no no, you don’t pay anything. It’s 100% free to work with me. I’m paid a referral fee from whatever apartment you choose for sending them a qualified renter ",,,,,
Lead,Okay thank you! I kind of forgot and just wanted to reclarify!,,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Lead,I got here like 5 minutes early ,,,,,
Agent,"GM! Okay great! I’ll be here to help anyway I can so If you need anything at all or have questions please don’t hesitate to call/text/voice message me. Good luck touring, I know we’ll find the one 🤞🏼 I can’t wait to hear how everything goes!",,,,,
Lead,I think so far I like the first two apartments compared to the third one. The I forget what it's called I want to call it the gray area but I don't think that's what it is gray garden something it's a bit out of my price range but I like it I mean it's real nice.,,,,,
Lead,Sorry I'm voice texting but the first one was my personal favorite and then they offered to waive the application fees if I signed within the next two days I don't know if you'd agree with that?,,,,,
Agent,"Sounds good! Okay, no worries. I’m not sure which you’re referring too that’s out of price range…

Yes, definitely all for them waiving the application fees! The apartment working with me doesn’t affect the deal you receive at all. Getting those fees waived are perfect ",,,,,
Lead,West end I don't know what I was talking about gray gardens that's my bad,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, no worries. They shouldn’t be out of range though. Just to clarify, what’s your range and amount of bedrooms/space again?",,,,,
Lead,"It was 1300-1400, 1bed at 640-720sqf",,,,,
Lead,West end was approaching 1400-1500,,,,,

Agent,"Can I suggest one more? 
The Ryon - 1 bed | 709 sqft | $1200

livetheryonapts.com",,,,,
Lead,no  you're fine. That's my fault for not being more specific ,,,,,
Agent,That’s okay. Take a look at the Ryon website and let me know if you’d like to stop by,,,,,
Lead,Okay,,,,,
Agent,"West End has a 640 sqft unit for $1324 too, available June 29",,,,,
Lead,Yes I saw that one today ,,,,,
Lead,She was showing me similar models,,,,,
Lead,And I think I saw one that was 840 sqf,,,,,
Agent,Okay. Silos harvest green will be on the higher end. Lowest price is $1380,,,,,
Agent,Let me know your final thoughts when you finish up,,,,,
Lead,I don't want to tour any other apartments today I have a shift later to work. Thank you for your help but I'll get back to you on the ryon a different day,,,,,
Agent,That’s no problem. Pleasure is all mine. Let me know how you plan to move along and if you want to take advantage of the waived application fees at Territory at Williams way in the next two days. I’ll be here if you need anything ,,,,,
Lead,Can we go ahead with the application for the territory ,,,,,
Agent,"Sure thing, I think it would be unit #9308 you’re interested in for $1335. 630 sqft, that sound right?",,,,,
Lead,Sounds about right yes,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, you can find it using this link",,,,,
Agent,https://www.territorywilliamsway.com/models?utm_knock=gppc&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20677889996,,,,,

Lead,Hi I am so sorry everything has been delayed a bit due to some personal stuff. Let me get back to you!!,,,,,
Agent,"No worries, I hope everything is okay. Please do! ",,,,June 3,
Agent,"Hey Lilli, wanted to reach out to help any way I can. Is everything still on hold for now?",,,,June 13,
Lead,As of right now I apologize but yes everything is on hold. ,,,,,
Lead,Thank you for checking in on me 🙏🏻,,,,,
Agent,"No need to apologize. Okay, sounds good, I’ll be here when you’re ready!",,,,,
Agent,And of course!,,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,"Hey Janay, it’s Ashanti from IG! So sorry for the delayed message, I picked up the flu and had to shut it down for a few days. 

Just so I send options for the right move dates, when exactly do you need to be moved in by?",,,,,
Lead,"Hi, I hope you are feeling much better! I need to be at least moved in by the 23rd or I can extend it to the 30th",,,,,
Agent,"Thank you! I definitely am. Got it, will you be attending or working at San Jacinto College, the reason you’d prefer to be in 77089?",,,,,
Lead,You're welcome. Working. ,,,,,
Lead,I won't be attending or working at the college. ,,,,,
Lead,I preferably liked that apartment you posted and the specific amount ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, those apartments are called The Rosemary and best price on the 2 bedroom now will be $1389 with the special self-prorated. We can definitely schedule a tour with them if you like. 

Just so I’m clear on area. Are you wanting to be close to 77089 for work and open to Humble if you don’t see what you want in that zip code?",,,,,
Lead,"Okay, great! That price definitely works. And yes, to being close to the 77089 zip code, but I am open to the Humble location for those particular apartments. ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, got it! And price at $1500 is that flexible at all or do you need that to be your strict max?",,,,,
Lead,$1500 is fine. ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, some 2 bedrooms in that price range will be income restricted. What is your gross monthly income and estimated credit score?",,,,,
Lead,"Okay, that's fine. $3,250 every other week. Credit score 702. ",,,,,I ask this question when qualifying to know how much a lead can be qualified for
Lead,My apologies for the delay. ,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning, okay great. What email can I send options to?",,,,,
Lead,janayfisher7@gmail.com,,,Time to send list,,
Agent,"Perfect, thanks! I just emailed your list
 
Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

You’ll notice some options slightly above $1500. You make too much to qualify for low income housing soon don’t add them but most options i sent are running specials that will bring rent under $1500

Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,List sent,,
Lead,Sounds great!!! Thank you so much for all your help. I will definitely be in contact with you as soon as I review the list that you sent. Thank you again. ,,,,,
Agent,The pleasure is all mine! Sounds perfect ,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Janay, no rush but were you planning on getting tours scheduled for this weekend?",,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, not this weekend. I'm working all weekend. ",,,,,
Lead,"If I find another apartment that's not on your list, can I still put you down for a referral? ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay no worries. Yes, please do. You’d still get your $200 rebate of course. Ideally let me know what building before you tour so I can send your guest card before hand to ensure I receive credit for us working together.",,,,,
Lead,"Okay, great, I will keep you updated. I will look at the list tonight. I've been busy with work. ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, sounds great. No worries ",,,,,
Lead,Awesome ,,,,,
Lead,"Hi, I know which apartment I want. ",,,,,
Lead,*Lead sends Screenshot of apartment name,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning. I believe you make too much money to qualify for that unit. You must make between $39,120-42,480 per year if you’ll be the only person in the household to qualify",,,,,"That particular apartment unit is ""income restricted"""
Agent,"They have another one. Their B2 floorplan , 2bed/2bath - 1180 square feet, that is $1460 that you would qualify for. Would that work?",,,,,
Lead,"Hi, that's a decrease in the floor plan and the price is higher... why is that? ",,,,,
Agent,"Good morning, that’s because that floor plan is an essential housing floor plan and is income restricted. It’s part of a city program for people with lower income that you don’t qualify for because your income is too high",,,,,
Lead,"Okay, i understand ",,,,,
Agent,Do you want to schedule a tour for The Henry?,,,,,
Lead,Yes,,,,,
Lead,Wednesday ,,,,,
Agent,Okay. I’ll let you know when it’s confirmed,,,Time to schedule tour,,
Lead,Thank you ,,,,,
Agent,Happy to help!,,,,,
Agent,"Good afternoon Janay, your tour at The Henry at Liberty Hills is Wednesday at 10am. 

You’re most interested in the B2 floor plan, unit #2308. Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Lead,Awesome! Will do,,,,,
Lead,"Hi, can you reschedule my tour for tomorrow ",,,,,
Agent,Morning or afternoon?,,,,,
Lead,Morning,,,Need to reschedule tour,,
Agent,Okay 👍🏼 ,,,,,
Agent,All set for tomorrow at 10am,,,,,
Lead,Awesome! Thank you so much! ,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is all mine!,,,,,
,Good morning ☀️good luck touring today! If you need anything at all or have questions please don’t hesitate to call/text/voice message me. Can’t wait to hear how it goes!,,,,,
Lead,"Hi, I didn't get to make my tour the other day. I had a family emergency. I'm just getting back. ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’m sorry I hope everything is okay. When would you like to reschedule for?",,,,,
Lead,Everything is okay for now. Thank you for your concern. Let me check my schedule ,,,,,
Agent,Okay good. Of course. Sounds good,,,,,
Lead,👍,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Janay, have you decided on an apartment already or still need to tour?",,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, I'm waiting on my SSC, I had to order another one. ",,,,,
Agent,Okay no problem. Let me know when you’re ready to get going again,,,,,
Lead,"Okay, will do",,,,,
Lead,"Hi, is there any way I can use my digital copy? ",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Janay, I'm so sorry. Not sure how this slipped by me. Are you all set or still looking?",,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, im still looking but I only have my digital social",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, do you have your Drivers license or are you waiting on that too? ",,,,,
Lead,I have my DL,,,,,
Agent,You’d be good to tour then. Prices have changed since we were first looking though. What’s your max price and number of bedrooms you need?,,,,,
Lead,"Hi, I'm really not trying to go over 1200 a month. A 1 bedroom would be fine. My job has recently changed ",,,,,
Agent,Okay got it. I’ll send some options tonight and we’ll start getting you set up for some tours 👍🏼,,,Time to schedule tours,,
Lead,Okay,,,,,
Agent,Did you want to be close to your new job? What location is ideal?,,,,,
Lead,The henry apartments can still be an option. ,,,,,
Agent,You’ll have better options under $1200 if you want a few different choices,,,,,
Lead,"Okay, that will be great ",,,,,
Agent,What area is close to work?,,,,,
Lead,I work in humble and also in the 77089 area ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay. Best options would be Grove east, The Henry at lake Houston and the Henry at liberty hills",,,,,
Lead,Okay,,,,,
Lead,I would have to look those up,,,,,
Agent,Okay,,,,,
Lead,Okay,,,,,
Lead,Thank you,,,,,
Agent,Of course ,,,,,
Lead,😊,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Janay, did you want to get scheduled for Grove East and The Henry?",,,,,
Agent,"Good afternoon Janay, sorry I know things get busy quickly. Any thoughts on when you’d like to tour?",,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, things been crazy on my end. Where are these located?",,,,,
Agent,"Understood, no worries. Grove east is in Humble and The Henry at liberty hills is close to Humble but a little south east of it. ",,,,,
Agent,I’d definitely recommend seeing grove east as soon as possible. They have two 1 bedroom units at $1138 that I think would work perfectly. I’d want you to tour before someone applies,,,,,
Lead,"Okay, my schedule has changed and will an offer letter work to apply since I've started a new job? ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, yes an offer letter should be fine",,,,,
Agent,What day will work best for you to tour?,,,,,
Lead,Great,,,,,
Lead,Let me check my schedule ,,,,,
Agent,Okay,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Janay, checking in quick. What day did you find works best?",,,,,
Agent,"Good morning Janay, I wanted to make sure you're all set with your apartment search. Have you already decided on a place?",,,,,
Agent,"Hi Janay, just checking in!
I wanted to follow up and see if you’ve already found a place or if you’re still needing help with your search. No rush at all—I know things can get hectic, so just let me know whenever you're ready to pick things back up!",,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, I will definitely be in touch. I might switch locations, but I will let you know for sure next week. Fingers crossed, I can get something going soon! Thank you again for all your help!!!!",,,,,
Agent,Good morning! That sounds good. Crossing my fingers for you 🤞🏼 The pleasure is all mine!! I'll be here if you need!,,,,,
Lead,Awwwww!!! Thank you so much. You are a sweetheart ❤️,,,,,
Agent,Happy to help 😌,,,,,I did not follow up efficiently after this point 
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Alayna, it's Ashanti with AptAmigo. Save this number instead",,,,,Had a previous conversation with lead
Lead,okay,,,,,
Lead,"hey ashanti, when should i start applying for the apartments ?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Alayna, so you’re scheduled to visit Houston July 1st and looking to move in around Aug 1st right?",,,,,
Lead,yes,,,,,
Agent,Okay were you wanting to see apartments before applying? Or make a decision to apply based on virtual tours then see the apartment you applied to?,,,,,
Lead,will applying to more than 1 effect my credit ?,,,,,
Agent,Potentially. Most are a hard pull that can affect your score just a few points for each application. Best practice is to search and apply to your favorite one (just one). App + admin fees can be a couple hundred dollars too so I don’t suggest doing multiple application because you’d have to pay each application fee,,,,,
Lead,okay then i would rather apply after seeing them in person,,,,,
Agent,Okay sounds good. Before you come I'll get you all your best options and you’ll have a full tour schedule already laid out for you 👍🏽,,,,,
Lead,great thank you!,,,,,
Agent,My pleasure!,,,,,
Agent,Hey Alayna! I was going to get your list ready to choose from so we can start scheduled tours for next week. Is the plan still to be in Houston on the 1st?,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, the plans have changed a bit but these plans are set in stone now. I will move to Houston July 14th and I will be there permanently. I will stay in an airbnb while we find an apartment, get furniture etc & we hope to be moved into an apartment by August 2nd.",,,,,
Lead,I also found an apartment that I like I was wondering do you only work with certain properties?,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, sounds perfect. Most apartments work with us but not every one of them. Which apartment?",,,,,
Lead,Beckett Cottingham,,,,,
Agent,Yes they work with us. We can definitely see them when you’re in town,,,,,
Agent,Is that the only one you had your eye on so far?,,,,,
Lead,Prose South Main and Haven at Main,,,,,
Agent,Got it. All else is the same? Budget under $1800 within 30 mins of Texas Southern?,,,,,
Lead,yes,,,,,
Agent,I’ll be searching for others up until you come. Do you want to start touring that Monday the 15th?                                                                                                                                                                                                ,,,,,
Lead,yes the 15th works ,,,Time to schedule tours,,
Agent,Okay,,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, so for Beckett Cottingham we have to pay first and last month rent to move in. Will all of the apartments be like that ?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Alayna, what do you mean? Did you tour and apply already?",,,,,
Lead,"no, i read the breakdown on the site i will show you ",,,,,
,*Lead sends screen shot of price breakdown,,,,,
Agent,"The deposit depends on your approval status but they all start at $350. Full approval the deposit will be $350. If you’re approved with conditions the deposit will be more, up to a full months rent",,,,,
Lead,okay ,,,,,
Agent,Hey Alayna! Wanted to check in on your day of tours. How did everything go today?,,,,,
Lead,"hey ashanti, i went to one of my tours i really liked that one ! i rescheduled the other one to wednesday",,,,,
Agent,Nice! Which one did you see today and which is Wednesday?,,,,,
Lead,haven at main was today & nantucket is wednesday,,,,,
Agent,Okay sounds good. Will you be seeing Beckett Cottingham too?,,,,,
Lead,"yes, did you want me to schedule that one or will you do it ",,,,,
Agent,When would you like to see it? I’ll schedule. Are there any others you specifically wanted to add?,,,,,
Lead,wednesday at 12:30 would be great & no i am still open to all suggestions !,,,,,
Agent,Okay sounds good. I’ll get you set up and see if I can add others!,,,Time to schedule tours,,
Agent,"Good morning Alayna, you’re all set for Beckett Cottingham tomorrow at 12:30pm 👍🏼",,,,,
Lead,thank you !,,,,,
Agent,You’re welcome! I truly think you have the best options to choose from. Did you want to add Prose South Main? They were one of your original favorites and have a 2/2 for $1705. Last one available,,,,,
Lead,yes,,,,,
Agent,Tomorrow? What time?,,,,,
Lead,is tomorrow at 2pm available,,,Time to schedule tours,,
Agent,"Yes, it’s scheduled for 2pm! You’ll get an invite soon",,,,,

Agent,Okay! Let me know where you guys stand when they’re all done 🤞🏼,,,,,
Lead,we want to apply for nantucket ! ,,,want to apply,,
Agent,Nice! Don’t have the unit picked out that you want to apply to?,,,,,
Lead,yes unit 302 ,,,,,
Agent,Okay awesome! Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help,,,,,
Agent,"When you start your application, please be on the look out for the referral section. Thats the only way the apartment takes care of me and allows me to step in on your behalf during the application process 👍🏼",,,,,
Lead,okay !,,,,,
Agent,Hey Alayna! Are you all set with the application? Already submitted or have any questions?,,,,,
Lead,"Hey, we have not submitted the application yet we will work on that later today i will let you know if we have any questions",,,,,
Agent,"Sounds good, I’ll be here if you have questions",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Alayna, all go well with your app? Were you able to submit, no problems?",,,,,
Lead,"hi ashanti, we haven’t applied yet i still have been waiting on my roommate to be ready & we are also going with beckett cottingham instead ",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Alayna, okay no problem thanks for the heads up. Please follow the same directions on your app for the referral section. And let me know however I can step in and be helpful",,,,,
Agent,"Good afternoon Alayna, just letting you know I’ll be here if you need. I know originally you wanted to be moved in by Aug 2nd so please keep me updated on your application status and if I can help communicate with the leasing office at all",,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, I am trying to submit my application but they do not have an option to put how i found them & i do not want to submit it without adding you ",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Alayna, did you see the question “How did you hear about us?” on the registration page?",,,,,
Agent,If not I’ll contact them today and see if they have a different process,,,,,
Lead,"hey, no there was no question ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, it’s possible they have you sign something when you move in stating I’m your locator. I’ll let you know",,,,,Human should know they need to look up referral process at this apartment 
Agent,"Hey, so they told me there’s a spot that is kind of easy to miss. It’ll say Referred by/who referred you/how did you hear about us/how did you find us? Something like that 

She said you can navigate back and she thought it was on step 1 or 2 earlier in the application

Sorry so vague 🫤 if you just can’t find it at all go ahead and still submit ",,,,,
Lead,"they made that up ! that is not on there, even when i start a new application ",,,,,
Agent,Mmm I’m going to see if I can get something in writing from them tomorrow. Thanks for double checking!,,,,,
Agent,You’re good to submit! Thanks for looking out for me 🙂,,,,,
Lead,no problem ! ,,,,,
Agent,Hey Alayna! Checking on you. Have you been approved yet?,,,,,
Agent,Quick follow up. Are you all good?,,,,,
Lead,"hey, yes ! ",,,,,
Lead,we were approved today,,,,lead said she was approved,
Agent,That’s great! Congratulations! I’m happy we found the right place. And thankful you decide to work with me. Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,"Also, I’ll need a few details so we can invoice the property correctly and ensure I get credit for referring you. Would you please confirm the details below:

Unit:
Base rent:
Move date:
Lease term:",,,,,
Agent,"Sent voice message: Hey Elena, yes I wanted to reach out real quick. I I spoke with Becca Cottingham and they they told me that your application wasn't fully submitted so I don't know if it was a mess up on on their end or what just kind of wanted to reach out let you know and and see what direction you were trying to go into so if you were trying to go in the direction of Becca, Cottingham, cool if not, and you had something else going on that you wanted to go in a different direction kindly just you know let me know where where you guys intended to go so I can kind of move from there and know what I'm just be on the same plane and as far as what we're doing all right, talk to you soon.",,,,Has a roommate so both never fully applied,
Lead,it’s because they are pulling my application not my roommates. my roommate completed the application & added me to it after i already started one that i didn’t submit ,,,,,
Agent,"Ooo got it, what’s your roommates name?",,,,,
Lead,Samiyyah Agee ,,,,,
Lead,we are also going there now so i can get it figured out,,,,,
Agent,Okay perfect thanks. Okay sounds good,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Alayna, what apartment number were you approved for?",,,,,
Lead,"the new apartment is Prose South Main
Apt #5208 ",,,,Approved at a different apartment ,
Agent,"Perfect, thanks! And how many months is your lease?",,,,,
Lead,12 months,,,,,
Agent,Thanks!,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Agent,"Good evening Lila! its Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form to let us help with finding your next apartment! I’ll send all the best deals and specials for your move date, I just need to clarify a few things from your form submission. 
 
Is your move date flexible or do you have a lease ending?",,,,,
Lead,"Lease ends Aug 1, so move in date is flexible between July 15-30",,,,,
Agent,"Perfect, thanks! Is moving in with a pet the reason for the private yard?",,,,,
Lead,Yes,,,,,
Lead,The private yard is a must have,,,,,
Agent,"Got it! Is there anything else you want to mention that would make the apartment perfect? Apartment features, amenities, size, etc?",,,,,
Lead,Def needs a washer and dryer in the unit! Nothing else too crazy!,,,,,
Agent,"Got it, and for budget is $1800 absolute cut off point?",,,,,
Lead,Depends on what utilities are included I guess! But for rent alone yes probably around there ,,,,,
Lead,And can’t be more than 30 minutes from Rice University!,,,,,
Agent,Okay got it. I’ll send some options tomorrow and we can start scheduling tours!,,,,,
Lead,Thank you!! ,,,,,
Agent,Happy to help!,,,,,
Lead,I saw your email. I made an account but how do i get to the ones that have the yards and are in my price range and area?,,,,,
Agent,"Morning Lila, I wasn’t quite done marking recommendations. For the yard are you looking for first floor with a patio/balcony or is it mandatory that you have some kind of grass?",,,,,
Lead,"Oh gotcha! I see. Yes mandatory to have some grass. Just for my dog to use the bathroom. Obviously the larger the yard the better, but we do need some sort of grass",,,,,
Agent,Got it! You can see my recommendations in real time in your account. I still need to call up some of the buildings to verify there’s grass in the yard. I’ll do that today,,,,,
Lead,Thank you very much! And just to clarify—your services are free and we just should refer you on our application? ,,,,,
Agent,"I’m happy to help! And yes correct, 100% free. No charges or changes to your lease. Please just refer me on the application and the property you choose will credit me for the referral.",,,,,
Agent,Preserve at Highway 6… That distance from Rice is OK for you?,,,,,
Lead,A bit far for us but we can look. Seems like the yard is gravel though so if that’s the case that wouldn’t work,,,,,
Lead,Can I schedule tours for the ones you recommended already? ,,,,,
Agent,"You can either schedule and update me on the date & times or I can schedule for you. I’d be happy to, it’s up to you ",,,,,"Not typical. I usually schedule tours for all leads so there is a thread showing I was the one who scheduled, in case a building wants to challenge our referral"
Lead,Sounds good!! ,,,,,
Agent,"When do you plan to tour your favorites? Avasa and The Westover, I’ve confirmed those units have yards!",,,,,
Lead,we setup both tours for tomorrow!,,,,,
Agent,Perfect! What time are they set for?,,,,,
Lead,1 and 2pm!,,,,,
Agent,Perfect! Are you seeing Preserve at Highway 6 also?,,,,,
Lead,probably this weekend!,,,,,
Agent,Good morning!☀️ I wanted to check in on how tours have gone so far. Any top choices yet?,,,,,
Lead,Hi! We really like the Preserve on Highway 6!,,,,,
Agent,Nicee!! Did you guys want to put in your application or are there any concerns keeping you from applying?,,,,,
Lead,Our only large concern would be how much gravel there is in the backyard! We honestly wish it was all grass or turf ,,,,,
Lead,Our dog is known to try to eat rocks,,,,,
Lead,That is one of the major things making us second guess,,,,,
Agent,Ahhh I see! My thoughts are that 800 sqft plus nice sized yard well within price range is an outstanding deal. We’ll need to determine if yards with gravel are a dealbreaker. Is The Preserve the only community you guys can see yourself living out of all the places toured?,,,,,
Lead,"Yes just the best price for the size we think. Just struggling bc the reason our need was a yard was so we could let our dog off and not have to worry about putting her on leash, and we might have to do that here if she tries to eat the gravel. Maybe we can lay turf strips on top of the gravel or something? ",,,,,
Lead,But thinking of potentially signing tomorrow or tuesday,,,,,
Lead,We have one more to tour tomorrow,,,,,Mentioned they are touring tomroow
Agent,"Agreed. Yes, understand that for sure. And turf strips are a really good idea! ",,,,,"Asking so I can send ""guest card"" email to the apartment to guarantee we get credit"
Agent,"Okay, sounds good. What is your tour tomorrow so I can send your guest card ahead?",,,,,
Lead,The Village at Bellaire,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, The Village is an older build. Built in 1990 so the aesthetic will be much different than you’ve already seen, I just want you to be prepared for that. ",,,,,
Lead,Gotcha yeah just wanting to see something that’s super cheap too to weigh options ,,,,,
Agent,"Love it. Okay, love to know how it goes!",,,,,
Lead,Will let you know!,,,,,
Lead,We might just go ahead and sign today! What all info do I need to know?,,,,,
Agent,Nice! I think you guys will love it there honestly and you’re getting an AMAZING deal! ,,,,,
Agent,You’re good to apply right on the website if you know the unit you want. For listing me as your referral look for anywhere that asks “How you hear about the property” or Who referred you” and list me (Ashanti with AptAmigo) 🙏🏼 Thanks in advance!,,,,,
Lead,We are gonna go there in person to fill out the application!!!,,,,,
Lead,bc we wanna make sure the unit is the exact one we want,,,,,
Agent,"Oh perfect! In that case, just tell them you want to make sure I’m listed as your referral. They will guide you from there!",,,,,
Lead,Perfect! I’ll keep you posted once we’ve signed.,,,,,
Agent,Sounds perfect!,,,,,
Lead,Signed and she has your information! ,,,,,
Agent,Awesome! Thank you for referring me 😌 Let me know once you’ve been approved and if there is aaanything I can do to be helpful in the meantime!,,,,,
Agent,Of course! Thank you for the recommendation! Will do!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Lila! Checking in quick, have you guys been approved yet? 🤞🏼",,,,,
Lead,"We have had trouble all weekend with the income verification website, but just got it to work today so should hear back any time now",,,,,
Lead,We were pre approved though when we applied,,,,,
Agent,"Aw man. Okay sounds great, keep me updated. I’ll be here if you need",,,,,
Lead,Will do!!,,,,,
Lead,Hoping we hear for sure tomorrow,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Lila, following up to make sure you guys are all set. Did ya’ll get the approval back?",,,,,
Lead,"Hey, we have had so much trouble getting in contact with them. We finally did 2 days ago, and they said that they needed pay stubs from both of us, so we sent it over. Still haven’t heard anything since then",,,,,
Lead,Makes us a bit worried because we tried to call them 4 days in a row and heard nothing/no answer. I’m sure they’re busy but a bit nerve-wracking ,,,,,
Agent,"I’m really sorry to hear that. I know that could be so concerning. If it means anything, that’s been a trend this summer with apps taking a lot longer to be approved. It’s been hectic around the board with an influx of new renters especially for the brand new apts. If you guys don’t hear back by say Tuesday/Wednesday let me know and I’ll find some time to head over to see what I can do to speed up the process",,,,,
Lead,Amazing thank you very much for your help!,,,,,
Agent,Absolutely!,,,,,
Lead,"Just called and left another message. Very concerned that we are already having problems. In your experience, is this too big of a red flag?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey, good afternoon! I just spoke to Shelby in the office. They picked right up. She’s the final approver and said they’re just waiting for your income verification. She said you won’t be able to send it directly in the website and that you’ll need to email it to them and that will be the last step. 

She said she hadn’t received paystubs and to send them directly to her at highway6mgr@greystar.com

She’ll be in the office until 6pm if you need her. Make sure you’re calling 281-845-9748",,,,,
Lead,Amazing thanks so much. We just called and emailed over those stubs. She said she’d look at them and let us know re:approval within 45 min! ,,,,,
Agent,My pleasure! That sounds perfect!,,,,,
Lead,Really appreciate it,,,,,
Agent,"Absolutely, that’s why I’m here ",,,,,
Lead,I believe we were just approved!,,,,,
Agent,🥳Congratulations!! Sorry it took so long! I’m happy you guys can start to plan around your move. So happy for you,,,,,
Lead,Thanks!!! Really appreciate your help through this process. ,,,,,
Agent,The pleasure has really been all mine. Thanks for deciding to work with me ,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning Lila! Thanks again for working with me! When you get a chance can you please send these details so we can invoice the property correctly and ensure I receive credit for us working together…

 How soon do you need to move? Do you have a lease ending or no lease?",,,,,
Lead,My lease ends Aug 11,,,,,
Agent,Got it. You mentioned wanting more space. Will the 2 bedroom be more space in itself or were you looking for a certain amount of square feet?,,,,,
Lead,The former,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, what areas are you open to living?",,,,,

 Let me know if you have any questions! I’ll check in tomorrow if I don’t hear from you to see if I can help at all",,,List Sent,,

 I know some of these are older so prices may have changed and some are repeats but if I could see more like these with more lighting/windows, that would be great",,,,,Lead asking for apartment info on links
Agent,"Hi Anita, so sorry for the late text but I wanted you to have some info by the time you work up. One thing I want to point out when looking on instagram is anytime you see videos that say prices “starting” or units “start at”, that just means units at that building, and are usually the lowest priced studio but the video showing one of the higher priced units. Each of the units in the videos are going for over 3k guaranteed. 
 
 That being said if you want to have your space, I suggest we look for really large one bedrooms or 1 bedrooms with a den to serve as a second bedroom. A true two bedroom will all the unit features you want will be hard to find in our budget. What are your thoughts on that?
 
 I added 7 or so new options to your list for you to look over. They’re either large one bedrooms or 1 bedrooms with an extra den/study. Let me know which ones catch your eye
 
 
 All of the apartments in the videos you sent are listed below…
 
 The Laura
 The Travis
 Ellison Heights
 Modera Waugh",,,,,
Lead,"Thank you for your due diligence already. 
 
 I’ve taken a look and favorited a few ID like to see in person.
 
 I wanted to ask cause I’ve been seeing this location a lot 
 
 https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8IYh2Zvkpj/?igsh=MWptM3lxM2VtNG5nNQ==
 
 Is this apart of the list and if so which one is it?
 
 Thank you",,,,,
Agent,"My pleasure. I’ll take a look at your favorites and we can get them set up today. Does tomorrow and Sunday work for tours?
 
 Yes that is the Laura East River. It is within your list",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Anita, I was going to go ahead and get your tours set up. Does anytime Saturday & Sunday work?",,,,,
Lead,"Hey so I went to look at the Laura today. It went well. I liked the apartment and the finishes. The amenities are fine. 
 
 I was wondering if I increased my budget to 2800, would I have better options to choose from?",,,,,
Agent,"Okay perfect, I’m glad you liked them! Next time can you let me know you’ll be going before hand? Some properties are strict about me sending your guest card ahead of your tour in order for me be linked as your locator. 
 
 That will open up your options a bit. Are you looking exclusively for a 2bed or is a 1 bed with a den okay?",,,,,
Lead,"A den is fine bu I want something that’s floor to ceiling windows, wood floors, nice amenities still",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, is a balcony mandatory?",,,,,
Lead,No it’s not,,,,,
Agent,Liked “No it’s not ”,,,,,
Agent,"Morning Anita, I added a few more options to look through. One that I really want you to see is the A16 at The Travis going for $2153. It’s 1136 sqft has a den and a 2nd half bath. Also has a wrap around porch so you’ll be get soo much light. Also a Highrise. One of the best deals in the city right now. Available Aug 11. I’ll leave a floorplan photo below",,,Sent list,,Sent more options based on new info lead said she wanted
Agent,,IMG_0503.PNG,,,,
Agent,"And again, please let me schedule your tours or at the very lease let me know where you’ll be going beforehand so I can send your guest card. As you know my service is 100% commissioned so I count on the clients I work with to reward me with the referral on any application for my help. Thanks in advance!",,,,,
Lead,Is there a video for this one? Also can you set up a tour for me for this?,,,,,
Agent,"No video unfortunately. Absolutely, what time would you like to see it?",,,,,
Lead,Anything available for today? Like 2 or 3pm?,,,Time to set up tour,,
Agent,"The earliest guided tour option is tomorrow at 11:30am. I went ahead and scheduled for then just to have something scheduled. 
 
 They also have an option to do a self guided tour with your locator. I can meet you there today at 3pm. Does that work?",,,,,
Lead,Yes let’s do self guided at 3,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll meet you there",,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,"You’re welcome! Just know it’s possible we can’t see the exact unit. But you’ll be able to see a similar unit, the building, amenities, etc. They’ll likely have video of the unit too",,,,,
Lead,Ok by similar do you mean the same floor plan just not the exact unit?,,,,,
Agent,"No, we’d be lucky to see the exact floor plan. There’s only that one available and it’s becomes available in August. We would see a different floor plan so you can see the finishes and hopefully see I video of the exact unit",,,,,
Lead,Ok could you confirm ahead if they have a video of the exact unit?,,,,,
Agent,"Yes, if I can catch them. There’s only one leasing agent in today who’s booked all day for tours. I’ll let you know if I get confirmation",,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,

Agent,Happy to help!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Anita! Hope you had a good weekend. Any thoughts on the Travis or setting up tours for my favorite, Parkside Residences?",,,,,
Lead,"Hey I don’t think I’ll be going with the Travis. The top are the laura and forth. Yes we can set up Parkside. 
 
 I might be able to tour Tomorrow or Friday",,,Time to book tour,,
Agent,"Okay, I like those choices. Tomorrow is fully booked besides 9am. What time Friday would work best?",,,,,
Lead,Anything after 1:30?,,,,,
Agent,3pm work?,,,,,
Lead,Yes,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll schedule you. I just want you to know these will be larger 900+ sqft 1 bedrooms. Great for the aesthetic of your content, etc with floor to ceiling windows. But you won’t get that second room. Let me know if that’s a dealbreaker for you",,,,,
Lead,"Yea that is.
 
 I’ll sit with the Laura and forth until I make a decision then.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay cool, if I find anything I think is worth it I’ll send it to you. 
 
 If you decide to apply anywhere, it’s very important since I’m not on your guest cards that you list me as your referral on your application. That’s the only way I’ll be credited from the apt for my free service. If you know how to do it when applying, that’s perfect. If not please reach out before starting an application and I’ll guide you.",,,,,I didn't schedule some tours so letting her know it's important i'm listed as her referral when she applies
Lead,"Will do, thank you",,,,,
Agent,Thanks a bunch,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Anita, just wanted to keep you updated. I ran another search and really think The Laura and Forth at Nav are your best option right now. Outside of those we can check out The Mill Residences which are brand new. 2 beds start at $2750 + 6 weeks free. Let me know if you want to set up a tour",,,,,ran another search because I had a feeling she was making decisions without me
Agent,https://themillhouston.com/,,,,,

 Still sitting on Forth and The Laura to make your final decision?",,,,,
Lead,Yes and sounds good,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Yes and sounds good ”,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning Anita, I found out move ins for the Mill Residences were pushed back to September 4th. I’m sorry 😕 the date will be too far back unless you extended your lease for a month",,,,,
Lead,"Morning, Are there videos or anything I can see to see if it’s even worth viewing/waiting? I looked online but there’s not much yet",,,,,
Agent,"No, unfortunately not. They start tours early August and those will be hard hat tours at that.",,,,,
Lead,Do you know if the forth still has 2 bed corners available?,,,,,
Agent,I believe they have one available. Unit #613 starting at $2710. Did you want to go for that one?,,,,,

Lead,No the Hayworth isn’t my speed. I might pop in to the forth to tour once more this week/weekend.,,,,,
Agent,Okay no problem. Since I didn’t tour with you the first time and didn’t send a guest card can you let me know when you’ll be going again to Forth? I want to schedule you myself and be there this time,,,,,
Lead,Yes could schedule for anytime on Friday after 3 or Saturday?,,,Time to schedule tours,,

Lead,"Hey, thanks for checking in. It’s ok, definitely not resigning a lease but it’s fine!",,,,,
Agent,"Of course. Ahh man, anything in particular that isn’t up to par?",,,,,
Lead,Security is terrible. A car that parks right next to me was broken into my second week there and there’s no communication or support from management. It took years to fix the garage door when they said it be fixed much earlier. Just poor management overall. Nice gowns though.,,,,,
Agent,I’m really sorry to hear that. I’ll see what I can do to share your concerns (anonymously of course) with the office so they hear from me how some residents are feeling. If anything ever comes up that you think I can step in and help with please don’t forget about me!

Lead,Hello! Well I’m looking to move in August,,,,,
Lead,I do have an end lease it ends in 9/1,,,,,
Agent,Got it! Will you be moving from out of state or are you already local to Houston?,,,,,
Lead,Out of state,,,,,

Lead,"In transferring from my current job, I work in amazon so they are transferring me to Houston",,,,,

Lead,I can do that for sure,,,,,
Agent,Okay cool,,,,,

Lead,Btw loved that one,,,,,
Agent,No unfortunately none of the Allora or Prose apartments have balcony/patios. Partly the reason why they’re so well priced,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Btw loved that one ”,,,,,
Lead,Of course make sense lol,,,,,
Lead,Well still like it as long as is pet friendly I’m fine with it,,,,,
Lead,However if I can see the other ones I can take the choice today my friend,,,,,
Agent,Lol got you. Yes they’re pet friendly. Here is the A2 floorpan for Prose District West. It’s 830 sqft,,,,,
Agent,https://youtu.be/1mp0fNI5Bx8?si=FTO7tkj2yyLoUjQn,,,,,
Lead,Omg that looks really good too,,,,,
Lead,One question they both have the same amount of closets?,,,,,
Lead,Cause I see a few more on the A2 than the A3,,,,,
Lead,Probably cause on the A3 they never opened the closets on the video lol but just making sure,,,,,
Agent,Same number of closets. This one shows the hallway closet in the A3,,,,,
Agent,https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODY5Njc2ODYxOTE1MDU5?story_media_id=3172158769757109388&igsh=eW9jdmE1OGYwZGZh,,,,,

Agent,https://havenatmissiontrace.com/virtual-tours/,,,,,
Lead,"Le encantó “Haven at Mission Trace, you can see the virtual to…”",,,,,
Lead,Liked a lot this one,,,,,
Lead,Quick question is there a lot of difference between the A3 and the A2 on these one?,,,,,
Lead,In prices,,,,,
Agent,"Here is roughly what price will be for each
 
 Allora District West - (A3) $1400 + 6 weeks free = $1238/mo
 
 Allora Cinco Ranch - (A3) $1455 + 6 weeks free = $1287/mo
 
 Prose District West - (A2) $1325 + 6 weeks free = $1172/mo
 
 Haven at Mission Trace - (A2) $1375 + 6 weeks free = $1216/mo
 
 
 Keep in mind you will need to qualify for the market rate which is the first number before the special kicks in and these numbers shown are without the monthly fees which you can anticipate being $50-$100 per month (usually covers pest control, trash, amenity fee) and you will need to account for electricity, internet, and water",,,,,
Lead,Perfect if you can answer me the question about the A3 in the heaven at misión trace I’ll tell you my answer right now,,,,,
Agent,"Oh oh yes, that’s why I suggested the A2. The A3 will be $1525 + 6 weeks free = $1349/mo
 
 However, the A3 has a den as well and is 861 sqft so all-around bigger",,,,,
Lead,Yea that’s why I was asking,,,,,
Agent,,PNG image.jpeg,,,,
Lead,Well that being said I think I’ll go for that one,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll get all the info together for you to apply. Give me a second",,,,,
Lead,Perfect !,,,,,
Agent,"You’re going to get an email from them with a virtual tour. That just makes you eligible for their look and lease special which is a reimbursed app/admin on top of the 6 weeks free. 
 
 Look out for the email and let me know when received!",,,,,Spoke to office who told me they needed a virtual tour to be eligable for their move in special
Lead,Perfect let me check right now,,,,,

 You can apply with the link you received in the email and we’ll be working directly with Michelle through the application process so any questions you have you can direct to her or myself to get them answered",,,,,

Lead,In that case I’m out of home right now but I’ll be back in an hour could you still help me then?,,,,,
Lead,And no I haven’t start yet I was waiting for you lol,,,,,
Lead,And also by the time I start the offer is for only 12 months or can be more?,,,,,
Agent,"Yes I’ll still be able to help. And no I was saying use the link that says “click to start the application process” lol. 
 
 And you can choose more, the offer is for any lease that is 12-15 months",,,,,
Agent,Your phone will be fine if you really want to get it done. Desk top is just always recommended by leasing teams,,,,,
Lead,Yea so that’s why haha that link doesn’t work on my phone so I think I have to try on a computer,,,,,
Lead,I can only use the only one that says “for more information visit our website” but the one you are saying doesn’t work on the phone,,,,,
Lead,Actually they just sent me a new one but want to show you just in case,,,,,
Lead,,IMG_2279.PNG,,,,
Agent,"It actually doesn’t matter. You will be applying for unit #6204.
 
 You can use one of those links or use this link and choose A3 > #6204 > select the date you want to move in > select apartment locator as your referral > start application",,,,,

Lead,Alright I will do it in 20 min I’m driving home right now,,,,,
Agent,Liked “Alright I will do it in 20 min I’m driving home ri…”,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good!,,,,,
Lead,Im on it now,,,,,
Lead,Also I don’t know why but it didn’t shows me the right one,,,,,
Lead,Cause it doesn’t have an studio,,,,,
Lead,,74156017006__7ADAFC98-7365-484C-A005-73ACA34C0B12.HEIC,,,,
Agent,You’re applying for the right one as long as it’s the A3. I had the same question. That’s a mess up on their website,,,,,
Lead,Ahh gotcha,,,,,
Lead,Also it didn’t show me the 6204 it gave the 5204 instead is it okay?,,,,,
Agent,"Yes, that’s just fine",,,,,
Lead,Alright I’m on it now,,,,,
Notification,Jesús Machado ⚡️ unsent a message.,,,,,
Agent,Liked “Alright I’m on it now ”,,,,,
Lead,I’m putting my wife as the householder since she is the one that her transfer already done to Houston my letter is still in process to be done and I’ll put myself as a co-applicant,,,,,
Agent,Okay that’s fine,,,,,
Lead,What should I put on the total household rental voucher?,,,,,
Lead,Or nothing?,,,,,
Lead,That’s the only doubt I have,,,,,
Agent,For income? Or rental voucher?,,,,,
Lead,Rental voucher,,,,,
Lead,,74156184831__E7628FEF-DF3B-4E04-98C5-81F2FCFF6368.HEIC,,,,
Agent,Leave that blank,,,,,
Lead,Okay,,,,,
Lead,The only things is that it didn’t allowed me to put my income,,,,,
Lead,To support the income for the application,,,,,
Agent,"They ask for an amount, many times you’ll be asked to provide supporting documents after the initial application",,,,,
Lead,Ohh okay so for this I’ll only put her income,,,,,
Agent,Each one of you complete your own application. And you each submit your own individual income,,,,,
Lead,So okay I’m a little confused and sorry for it,,,,,
Lead,Right now I did put me as a co-applicant and her as a main applicant,,,,,
Lead,But how can I do my application if I only have one link for one application?,,,,,
Agent,"If this will be her application, she will do the application and put you as a co-applicant. When she submits her application you will receive a link via email to complete your portion as a co-applicant",,,,,
Lead,Got you that was my concern and sorry again I know is a dumb question,,,,,
Agent,That’s a great question. Let me know if you run into anything else,,,,,
Lead,Got you I should be almost done,,,,,
Agent,Liked “Got you I should be almost done ”,,,,,
Lead,I’m doing mine right now,,,,,
Lead,Hers is done,,,,,
Lead,All done!,,,,,
Lead,So do I have to wait for them to reply to me?,,,,,
Agent,Perfect! Yes just wait for a reply 👍🏼,,,,,
Lead,Alright just a quick question since I’m still waiting for my transfer letter do you think that would be a problem for me? I’m just waiting for it literally,,,,,
Agent,"No, you’ll be able to use your current bank statements/paystubs as proof of income",,,,,
Lead,Oh okay perfect,,,,,
Lead,They just sent me the request and Me and my wife just sent everything,,,,,
Agent,Perfect,,,,,
Lead,I’ll let you know as soon as I hear something from them,,,,,
Lead,Le encantó “Perfect”,,,,,
Lead,Hey how are you my friend ! Just keeping you updated i received a few emails from the leasing office but nothing regarding the approval so I’m still waiting just letting you know,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, sounds great! Thanks for the update. The office might be closed for the holiday tomorrow so I wouldn’t expect anything until the very earliest Friday",,,,,
Lead,"Yea I assumed , I just have a question so I was able to see how would be the monthly payment (as you said originally was 1525$) but when does it change to the 1349$? Or is a redound after the lease is over?",,,,,
Agent,"The $1349 is with the 6 weeks free prorated. You’ll be getting a 6 weeks free special meaning no rent for 6 weeks of your lease. Rather than take the 6 weeks free at one time you’ll spread it evenly each month, making each month $1349",,,,,
Lead,Exactly that’s what I thought just because I haven’t seen that yet on the application but I guess Is because I have to wait for the approval tho,,,,,
Agent,"Yes, it’ll be on your lease",,,,,
Lead,Got you got you,,,,,
Lead,Hello Ashanti how are you? Hey I just received my offer letter for my lease (and yes the price is like 100$ more for utilities which you spoke to me about it) but the total is 1627$ for a h month instead of the 1349$ with the 6 weeks off,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jesús, I’m good thanks. I hope you are too. What I believe you’re seeing is the base rent plus monthly fees. The 6 weeks free you will need to self prorate, which is spreading the 6 weeks free over your entire lease. 
 
 If that isn’t comfortable for you, you have the option of choosing the original unit we were looking at which is the 1Bed -A2 768 sqft. It won’t have the den, but base rent is $1375. When you self prorate the special for the A2 base rent will be right at$1216",,,,,
Lead,I will send you a pic real quick,,,,,
Lead,,FILE_0070.pdf,,,,
Lead,So I believe is not including the 6 weeks on the lease correct me if I’m wrong,,,,,
Agent,Yes the 6 weeks free is not reflecting in the rent. You will need to self-prorate. But I suggest you speak to the leasing agent who has been helping you to have them go over the special with you and how it will be best for you to self-prorate it,,,,,
Lead,It is Michelle the person who has been doing my application so should I talk to her? Do you think she can help me doing that?,,,,,
Agent,"Yes, talk to Michelle. Ask her how the special will be given. She can explain self-prorating the special also",,,,,
Lead,Alright I will talk to her tomorrow since At this time the leasing office is already closed,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, sounds good. Keep me in the loop",,,,,
Lead,I will for sure,,,,,
Agent,Liked “I will for sure ”,,,,,
Lead,Now that I see the file I think I understand now,,,,,
Lead,Cause the month of September says -1188,,,,,
Lead,,IMG_2298.jpeg,,,,
Agent,I see. I would still make sure you’re 100% clear with Michelle. You don’t want any surprises,,,,,
Lead,Yea for sure I’ll definitely will call her tomorrow,,,,,
Agent,Liked “Yea for sure I’ll definitely will call her tomorro…”,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jesús, just checking in. Were you approved yet?",,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti how are you? yeah I got approved and I already sent my documentation for the insurance and the electrical bill but however, I haven’t get any other message since then I’m still waiting and it’s been a week since then and they haven’t sent me anything so far.",,,,,
Agent,"I’m well thanks, I hope you are too. Okay, they’re probably just getting your welcome packet together to make sure you’re all set on move-in day. I’ll get in touch this week",,,,,
Lead,Oh man thank you I would really appreciate that,,,,,
Lead,"Le gustó “I’m well thanks, I hope you are too. Okay, they’re…”",,,,,
Agent,Absolutely!,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti how are you? Hope everything is going well , just wanted to ask you if you were able to reach out to the leasing office and find out something",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jesús, I’m well I hope you are too. Not yet, I called a couple times possibly caught them while on tour. I’ll follow up with you tomorrow with an update",,,,,
Lead,Alright sounds good sorry for bother you so late with this I appreciate your help thank you!,,,,,
Agent,It’s no bother. I’m happy to help!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jesús, Michelle said you’re all set. There’s nothing you need to do besides come in and pick up your keys on the 1st",,,,,
Lead,awesome ! Thank you you don’t think there’s no problem if we get there a few days latter because of the moving,,,,,
Agent,"You’re very welcome! No, that won’t be a problem",,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti how are you, hey since I had a great experience with you finding my place to live, my in laws are looking for a place to live there as well, however they are looking for a studio apartment or 1 bedroom apartment something cheap. So if possible I would really like to be you the one who helps me finding a place for them let me know your thoughts:)",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jesús, I’m great. I hope you are too.

Outgoing,"Hey Justine! its Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment! I just need to clarify a few things from your form submission. 
 
 How soon do you need to move? Do you have a lease ending or no lease?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hi Ashanti,
 Move in date can be August 1 and no lease ending.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I see on your form you want to be pretty central. Is there a job/school/family location, etc that you want to be close to?",,,,,
Outgoing,"I just emailed your list
 
 Take a look and let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour next weekend. Some do require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Definitely look into Bowen River Oaks. $1375 after specials and Highrise in River Oaks. Can’t beat that deal. Might be worth it to tour that one sooner than next wknd too because there’s only one and they go fast
 
 Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you",,,,,
Incoming,Just looked at all the options you sent me and i only like the Bowen River oak,,,,,
Incoming,When soon can we tour it,,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “I just emailed your list
 
 Take a look and let me …”",,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Soonest date is Tuesday at 12pm,,,,,
Outgoing,Does that work?,,,,,

Incoming,Hope you’re having a great day btw,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, it’s for a year. I hope you’re having a great day too. 
 
 The apt is called Modera Garden Oaks. It’s brand new and units are spacious.",,,,,
Outgoing,What day works best for you to see it?,,,,,
Incoming,Can we do Thursday I will be off work for 4th of July if possible,,,,,

Incoming,Sorry for the inconvenience,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Justine, okay I’ll reschedule for Saturday @ 2pm. 
 
 Keep in mind that since we spoke prices have changed and they’ve gone from 2 months free to 1 month free. Brand new buildings change prices and specials every time they hit a new target occupancy. Just a few things to keep in mind if any changes happen between now and Saturday. 
 
 I’ll let you know when I confirm the new time!",,,,,
Incoming,I completely understand. But Saturday works for me. Thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “I completely understand. But Saturday works for me…”,,,,,
Outgoing,Good for Sat @ 2pm! 👍🏼,,,,,
Incoming,Awesome! Thank you!,,,,,
Outgoing,No problem!,,,,,
Incoming,Ashanti can you see if we can get even better options if the total including water is $1600.,,,,,
Outgoing,This is Modera Garden Oaks. $1585 + 2 weeks free = $1533/month. Water I generally see less than $25 per month. And their monthly fees are only $35. Compared to other properties is really low. Plus you get a den. 847 sqft,IMG_0708.MOV,,,,

Incoming,Its definitely big excited to see it in person tho I hate the small island,,,,,
Incoming,1810 it beautiful but the one door fridge is not it 🤦🏽‍♀️. Definitely like modern garden tho more,,,,,
Outgoing,Each of those units comes with a movable island. And not all units at 1810 have the one door fridge lol. Not sure about the unit we’re after.,,,,,
Incoming,If that’s the case I would like to visit 1810 I like it!! Maybe we can schedule it for Saturday as well,,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Kyndra! It’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment! I just need to clarify a few things from your form submission. 
 
 How soon do you need to move to Houston? Do you have a lease ending or no lease?",,,,,
Incoming,I already moved out just traveling around now. Looking to move around October,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, how do you plan to tour apartments? Will you be visiting Houston before moving permanently?",,,,,
Incoming,I may not be able to. I’m open to it but it may have to be a virtual tour. I also have friends in Houston that can look for me as well,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Do you know what areas you’re looking to live?,,,,,
Incoming,"I like the area by the galleria, river oaks and medical area. Somewhere safe but those spots looked really nice on your IG for low rates. What areas are those",,,,,
Incoming,The high rise buildings were nice,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, all those areas are “inner-loop” Houston close to each other. I’ll send all that’s within your budget. 
 
 Houston apartments operate on a 60-day notice system. Meaning residents are required to submit a 60 day notice to vacate, which is when their units are put on the market for me to see, so not much is going to be showing for October right now. How soon were you looking to virtually tour and decide on an apartment?",,,,,
Incoming,Ok. Makes sense. I can look virtually at any time,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll take a look for October move-ins tonight. Looking forward to helping find your new place!",,,,,
Incoming,"Liked “Okay, I’ll take a look for October move-ins tonigh…”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Kyndra, after looking it’ll really be a waste of time to look right now. For an October move I suggest searching and applying somewhere in Aug/Sep. There may even be some new apartments to open up by then that are currently under construction. Save my number and reach out more like late July if you want to keep that move-date. That’s our best plan. That sound ok?",,,,,
Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “Ok ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Hey Kyndra! Checking in on you so we can start getting your apartment search in motion. Are you still looking to move to Houston around October?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes either end of October or beginning of November,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, we can start in a few weeks then. There’s one apartment called Tempo at White Oak. They haven’t open their doors for tours yet but will be in the next couple weeks. First move ins for them will be Oct/Nov. As soon as they open we’ll see those and your other best options for that time frame. Are you still leaning toward all virtual tours?",,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “Okay, we can start in a few weeks then. There’s on…”",,,,,
Incoming,Ok awesome. Yes virtual tour,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Ok awesome. Yes virtual tour ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay sounds perfect,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Kyndra, quick update! Tempo at White Oak still isn’t touring just yet. I’ll keep you posted when they are so we can knock out all of our tours within a couple days",,,,,
Incoming,Ok thank you.,,,,,
Outgoing,You’re welcome,,,,,
Incoming,Good morning. I really would like to be moved to Houston before November,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good afternoon. Okay perfect, we can definitely make that happen. Most of Octobers availability is already available for us to choose from. Are you looking to settle in a decision in the next week or so?",,,,,
Incoming,If I find the right place then yes,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll keep an eye out for when Tempo at White Oak opens and I’ll send a full list of apartments this week. We can look into your options and Tempo will be the last to consider",,,,,

Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Incoming,Good afternoon. Sent you an email,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey good afternoon Kyndra. Love those picks. It is usually more for top floor. I’ll get prices and floor plans together and check for top floor. I believe for Alexan only the A2 has a shower. All other floor plans have tubs. 
 
 I’ll start scheduling virtual tours and I can either get video or we can do FaceTime tours. Up to you. If FaceTime works let me know if tomorrow you’re available",,,,,
Incoming,I def want a tub too,,,,,

Incoming,I loved a couple others but they had bad reviews,,,,,
Outgoing,"Which ones? You picked 3 really good ones. My opinion out of the 3. Rosslyn I’d choose last. Really nice but location isn’t amazing. 
 
 I love Junction Heights, great property and great location, walkable too. 
 
 And I love Forth too. They’re a go-to for Highrises. Very nice, great management and you can see from the A4 I sent above, you can get those elevated ceilings which is a nice touch",,,,,
Incoming,I didn’t even want Rosslyn lol that was last choice,,,,,
Incoming,"The first one matches my vibe. I love it. Just need a tub and a top floor with a good rate lol. 
 
 I have an La storage unit I’m paying $500 a month for for when I re open my restaurant and I’m factoring that into my monthly capacity. Also trying to save to purchase a home in about a year",,,,,
Outgoing,"Lol well we can really scratch Rosslyn and come back to it if one of your top choices don’t work out? Just a good option to be slightly less on price 
 
 Forth has a top floor unit for $2021 and they’re running a special. I’ll need to confirm but I think they just changed it to 1 month free. 7/8 floor for $1976. But remember you’ll still have elevated ceilings and I behave they have a 2 foot concrete slab in between each floor so hearing neighbors over you is unlikely
 
 For Alexan top floor best price is $2055 + 6 weeks free depending on the floorplan you choose of course. Best price is $1920 + 6 weeks free",,,,,

Outgoing,I’ll FaceTime you. I just got here,,,,,
Incoming,Oh gotcha,,,,,
Outgoing,Are you ready?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes,,,,,
Incoming,My major concern with that place from the reviews are the thin walls and even more concerning is car break ins and theft. Almost all the negative reviews mentioned one or the other,,,,,
Outgoing,"Leasing agent told me those reviews were when they first opened and was because they constantly had contractors in so had to leave the gates open and had no security. She says since then there have been no issues and they have an officer who patrols the gate outside of business hours and nobody comes in who can’t directly open the gate 
 
 For noise she says if you’re below heavy walkers you can hear a muffled stomp but side by side you can’t really hear your neighbors unless they seriously blasting music and have the tv or speaker connected to the other side of the wall.",,,,,
Outgoing,She just sent a quote and says disregard the $2100 price. The price for the 4th floor A3 is $1802,,,,,

Outgoing,"A2 floor plan. First number is floor number so 519 will be 5th (top) floor. 
 
 519 rent will be $2020+ 6 weeks free = $1767 per month self prorated",,,,,
Outgoing,,IMG_1283.PNG,,,,
Outgoing,A4 floor plan. Unit 581 (5th floor) starts at $2135 which would be $1868 per month self-prorated,,,,,
Outgoing,"If you want to do the self prorated math yourself here’s the formula: 
 
 Rent ✖️10.5➗12 🟰self-prorated monthly price",,,,,
Incoming,Loved “A2 floor plan. First number is floor number so 519…”,,,,,
Outgoing,,IMG_1291.HEIC,,,,
Outgoing,Note: monthly fee is $135 but wifi is already included,,,,,
Incoming,Which floor plan was the first one at Alexan ?,,,,,
Outgoing,First was the A4,,,,,
Incoming,That was the bigger one right ?,,,,,

Outgoing,"Best options at Forth (A4 - Same floor plan we saw)
 
 525 (best price) not elevated ceilings
 
 747 - elevated ceilings and view of Downtown
 
 847 - Top floor with elevated ceilings and view of downtown
 
 
 Formula to self prorate the special:
 
 Rent ✖️12 ➗13 🟰 Self-prorated monthly price",,,,,
Outgoing,Yes,,,,,
Incoming,"Last question.
 Does forth have a monthly amenity fee? And charge for parking ?",,,,,
Outgoing,Yes I’ll get fees. One sec,,,,,
Outgoing,"Fees at Forth are $135 per month and includes pest control, valet trash, high speed internet, and 2 valet tasks per month (could be having them walk your dog or collect your laundry, etc) 
 
 Each resident gets a free assigned parking space also. 1 bedrooms get 1 free space. 2 beds get 2 free spaces. Also an option to purchase extra spaces",,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Fees at Forth are $135 per month and includes pest…”,,,,,
Incoming,Whew this is a hard choice.,,,,,
Outgoing,"I personally think you’d be happy in either community. I’d go with the place that you like your unit the most since that’s where you’d be spending the most time. I love Forth for their management team, the unit and building itself, amenities etc. it’s a cut above, being Highrise and all. 
 
 Alexan is really nice but in my opinion one step under Forth as a “luxury” building. Great location for all the accessibility to so much in walking distance. Forth not much walking distance but is so close to Downtown that you get so many attractions and restaurants close by",,,,,
Outgoing,"Tough one but me personally, I’d go with forth for my own reasons. Since you’re a chef, maybe having a grocery store walking distance from Alexan is a really great perk",,,,,
Incoming,Loved “I personally think you’d be happy in either commun…”,,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “Tough one but me personally, I’d go with forth for…”",,,,,
Incoming,I’m torn. I’m gonna think through it a bit.,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “I’m torn. I’m gonna think through it a bit. ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. The right spot will probably be a lot clearer for you after you sleep on it. Forth’s special is a 24 hour look & lease so you’d need to apply by this time tomorrow to get it. Just a heads up,,,,,
Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Incoming,Good morning. Of the options you gave i would want to go with Alexan. I also checked out The Flats at West Alabama and wondering if you have worked with them before?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning. Okay sounds great. Yes I’ve worked with The Flats. I don’t recommend them, but we can check them out. Their management office team is constantly turning over and the building itself doesn’t compare to any that we’ve seen so far",,,,,
Incoming,I didn’t realize Alexan apartment square footage was only 748. That would be the smallest apartment I’ve ever lived in and I have a good amount of stuff so I’m a little concerned about everything fitting,,,,,
Incoming,Liked “Good morning. Okay sounds great. Yes I’ve worked w…”,,,,,
Incoming,I have a large dining room table as well as couch and love seat then I also have a bar for alcohol etc. I’m not sure if it’s all gonna fit. I’m moving from a 2 bedroom and I already got rid of a lot of stuff,,,,,
Incoming,I really don’t want to have to pay for storage because I’ll be paying that big storage bill in Cali still.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Mmm okay. The biggest issue with finding bigger units within price range is gas ranges aren’t easy to come by. And I know that’s a deal breaker. The ones we looked at are still going to be the best bet to maintain that level of luxury, have space at least around 750+ sqft, have gas range. Other options would be to explore further locations or increase budget.",,,,,
Outgoing,"I’ll check our options again, I just don’t want you spending more than you need to. I can always go back for us to get an even better idea how everything will fit",,,,,
Incoming,ok yea gas range is essential. I just have to think through it. I dont think any of the floor plans I saw would allow me to keep my dining room table. So I just need to think about it. I paid a pretty penny for that table and I really love my table 😩,,,,,
Outgoing,Dang I’m sorry! Is your table and furniture huge? The model at forth had a smaller dinning table comfortably,,,,,
Outgoing,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CdgTmz1Dtiw/?igsh=N2hxOHB1a2JmMHY=,,,,,
Incoming,it seats 8. I can take the leaf out so it only seats 6 but its a rectangle,,,,,
Incoming,im trying to see if there’s a way I can come out there in the next couple weeks to see the places in person. its hard to gauge space looking at photos and videos,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “it seats 8. I can take the leaf out so it only sea…”,,,,,
Outgoing,"That would be perfect to see in person. Only issue is with Forth’s special being a look & lease. You wouldn’t be eligible for it if you decided on them and waited to apply. Your option there would be to apply now, and come see everything when you come down with no obligation to sign the lease",,,,,
Incoming,I’m gonna pass on forth,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. So now it’s pretty much Alexan but you want to see if the space will work for you?,,,,,
Outgoing,I could still drop by Flats at West Alabama for you to see yourself,,,,,
Incoming,"I actually looked back in may but if you don’t think it’s a good spot then maybe i shouldn’t consider.
 
 I liked square footage, pricing
 And the fact it has storage on site",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay. Yea I don’t think it’s built as well as the others and management and ownership seem to have their own internal issues. Personally wouldn’t recommend, especially not over the others",,,,,
Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Incoming,I saw that Alexan has an A5 floor plan that’s a little bigger. It’s not available till nov 2nd. I wonder if they are able to show that model ?,,,,,
Outgoing,https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cu185djtRsH/?igsh=MWNtMHdmN2VnbGczYg==,,,,,
Outgoing,Here’s the A5. I can call and ask if they have one to view.,,,,,
Incoming,This video is helpful,,,,,
Incoming,I may just have to get rid of my table 😩,,,,,
Incoming,I just looked at my calendar and I won’t be able to come out till October and that would be too late,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “This video is helpful ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Disliked “I may just have to get rid of my table 😩”,,,,,
Outgoing,"The table you loveee?? Dang I’m sorry! I’m telling you, the biggest issue is the gas range, it’s so hard to come by",,,,,
Incoming,I understand,,,,,
Incoming,I’m going to apply today . Where do I put your name?,,,,,
Incoming,I’ll apply for the A5 but if something becomes available in October maybe they will switch me to that,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay great, yes that shouldn’t be a problem.",,,,,
Outgoing,"On the app you’ll run into the referral section. It’ll say something like “who referred you?”, “referred by?” Or “how did you hear about us?” Something like that. 
 
 List “Ashanti with Apt Amigo/Nav Agency if it allows you and if there’s a dropdown, please choose Real estate agent/Apartment Locator 😊 that will be perfect",,,,,
Incoming,Online the application fee is $200 not $99,,,,,
Incoming,The larger unit is not on the top floor,,,,,
Outgoing,Let me check for unit. For the $99 it will be a credit that you receive back when approved,,,,,
Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Outgoing,…one sec,,,,,
Incoming,You aren’t coming up on drop down,,,,,
Outgoing,Do you see “locator/apartment locator/realtor” on the drop down or one of them?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes but your name isn’t on drop down,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7710.jpeg,,,,
Outgoing,That’s ok. As long as you choose one of those iterations of “locator” I’m fine. Those names are people who work in the office,,,,,
Outgoing,Thanks for checking,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7711.heic,,,,
Incoming,I’m gonna keep my table in the storage unit I’m keeping behind in La,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved an image,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, that’s good. You’ll get to keep it and not pay for a second storage. And the only A5 I’m seeing is for November 2nd. I’m on my phone, did you see another?",,,,,
Incoming,I decided against it because it’s not top floor. Gonna go with the A2 on 10/15,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7712.heic,,,,
Incoming,This won’t let me pick correct date I moved out,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “I decided against it because it’s not top floor. G…”,,,,,
Outgoing,What’s that question say? “Move-out date for previous residence”?,,,,,
Incoming,"Yes I moved out April
 This year but it won’t let me put that. I have to make it December of last year",,,,,
Outgoing,"Usually it’s because of a conflict of dates on some other entry. If they’re making you put December just put it, it’ll be fine",,,,,
Notification,Kyndra McCrary ⚡️ unsent a message.,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7713.heic,,,,
Incoming,This is more than what I thought,,,,,
Outgoing,"More or less, that’s pretty standard for fees upfront. These are the fees you’ll be getting credited back",,,,,
Outgoing,Would you feel more comfortable visiting first before committing?,,,,,
Incoming,I can’t come till October,,,,,
Outgoing,"Mmm, yea it’s pretty standard. There isn’t really a way around it. Good thing is you’ll get the $255 back when you move in",,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7715.heic,,,,
Incoming,"Good morning. I got
 This but I’m a little concerned about the Money back and 6 week free as I didn’t receive anything from them indicating any of this.
 
 It’s asking me to sign the lease but I don’t want to do that till I have in writing the other things.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning, okay no worries. They’ll be closed today for the holiday but I’ll get it in writing for you. Don’t sign yet",,,,,
Incoming,"Liked “Good morning, okay no worries. They’ll be closed t…”",,,,,
Outgoing,They should be confirming today in writing. Thanks for being patient,,,,,
Incoming,Ok thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,"Spoke with the hospitality desk and they said the special should be stated on your lease usually on the page showing monthly rent amount. 
 
 Wasn’t able to speak to an agent yet, I think they’re on tour but double check the actual lease to see if it’s there somewhere",,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Ok thank you ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Specials have been confirmed. Just emailed you,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Specials have been confirmed. Just emailed you”,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Spoke with the hospitality desk and they said the …”,,,,,
Incoming,I never got the actual lease it seems. Just access to the portal and a welcome email,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll double check to see when you should be receiving",,,,,
Outgoing,Go through the welcome letter and see if they’re asking for anything from you. Many times you’ll need to pay deposit and possibly show proof of renters insurance before your lease is sent. On the lease itself is where the special should reflect also,,,,,
Incoming,I sent it all. Can’t do renters insurance till I’m there because it’s only for 1 place at a time. Not gonna pay for it for there before I arrive,,,,,
Incoming,"They just asked me to do some pet thing, phone verification and to send bank statements. I did all of that",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay good, all we want is communication from the office. They’re asking for what they need so they’re on top of it. Give them a bit to verify the new info you sent but you’re already approved so all is good. They’re just checking the boxes they need to before you can sign your lease",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey good morning Kyndra, I hope everything is great. Sure I’d love to help. How soon will you be needing to move?",,,,,
Incoming,"Well I need to check with my current building to see if it’s possible to get out of my lease. If not my lease isn’t up till October. If they do allow it, I would want to move next month or by May 1st",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, what price point and areas/neighborhoods would you want to be in? I’ll do a quick check to see what recommendations I’d have before you go through the trouble of asking",,,,,
Incoming,"Heights, Montrose, Rice village, medical center, river oaks $1400-$1700",,,,,
Outgoing,Okay you’re good 100%. There will be plenty of options for you. Check with your office to see what the protocol is to get out of your lease and let me know what dates you’d definitely be looking at 👍🏼,,,,,
Incoming,So it’s gonna cost too much to get out of my lease so I’m gonna have to wait this one out.,,,,,
Incoming,They said I can transfer to a different unit but they don’t have any studios. I’ll check back in when it’s closer to the lease ending,,,,,
Outgoing,"Aw man. Okay, I’ll be here to help and you’ll definitely have plenty of options",,,,,

 How soon do you need to move? Do you have a lease ending or no lease?",,,,,
Incoming,Move in any date after June 29th. I do not have a lease.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, getting more specific on area. Do you work close to Ellington Airfield?",,,,,
Incoming,"Yes sir, Coast Guard Sector Houston to be exact.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Nice, thank you for your service. So studio or 1 bedrooms between $1000-1400 close to Ellington Airport. Are there any specific features you want at your apartment building or inside your unit?",,,,,
Incoming,"My pleasure, thank you for your support",,,,,
Incoming,"The main feature Im looking for is in unit W/D, and if possible a balcony",,,,,
Outgoing,"The pleasure is mine. Okay, got it. What days of the week will work best for your apartment tours?",,,,,

Outgoing,Absolutely!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Just emailed your list
 
 One that isn’t on the list but I think you should see is Dakota at Deer Park. New construction and they have studios for $1199 and 1bdrm for $1399. Just 15 mins from Ellington Airfield 
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour starting on Monday, ideally in the next 24-48 so we have plenty of time to schedule. Some do require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply (Also the only way I’m paid for my free service)- If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any app and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Incoming,"Upon review, Dakota Deer Park is the one that interests me the most. I did want to mention, since Im driving from Cali, can the tour be scheduled Tuesday or Wednesday?",,,,,

Incoming,If we could replace it with something around Midtown/Montrose or similar areas that would be ideal. My airbnb was in that area and I liked it.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, no problem. Let me take a look at what we can replace it with",,,,,
Outgoing,Since you’re okay with Studios do you have a square feet preference? I could have you check out a few options that have studios but I don’t want them to be too small for you,,,,,

Outgoing,"Okay, yes that may be fine. However for places like San Estrella (my favorite of the 3 you mentioned), they only have one of their 725 sqft one bedrooms under $1300. It may not last until this weekend. 
 
 Is first floor still necessary for you if the building has elevators?",,,,,
Incoming,"1st floor because of my dog lol i got him after i moved to my current place 
 The Dawson. We have elevators and I’m no where near it so it doesn’t help lol",,,,,

I know I’m pressed for time this storm put me really behind, I’ll be applying Tuesday morning so I’ll definitely call you so you can tell me what to add for your portion. If they can set up virtual tours this weekend that would be great if not ima just wing it and cross my fingers lol 🙏🏾",,,,,

Outgoing,Loved “YES!!!!! That’s perfect it’s so much bigger than m…”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Perfect!! I really like this one. The price point is great. The others you get outside of price point. San Estrella I really like but the unit they have available is for Aug 9th so it won’t work. The Ashford you’re at $1379
 
 Here at Neo you also will get September rent free. So if we’re comparing price, there’s no real comparison",,,,,
Incoming,YES!!!! ok great can i call you a sec?,,,,,

Incoming,I have an ID it expired in January if they wanna try this i can go today when im off idk help lol,,,,,
Outgoing,You need to have an id. Have you requested a new one yet?,,,,,
Incoming,That’s what this was for today but due to Microsoft systems are down nationwide,,,,,
Outgoing,Ask the apartment if you can apply with a SSN or if you can apply and have them wait until you get your ID credentials for them to process the application,,,,,
Incoming,Ok i will go today and take everything and see what they say I’ll keep you updated im off at 430,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay sounds good,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Ariel, how is it going with your application? Are you still waiting on your ID?",,,,,
Incoming,Yes ;(,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, if you haven’t already I’d say communicate with the office to let them know your situation. You may be able to apply with a temporary ID or passport just to start the application process incase the prices change",,,,,

Outgoing,"Perfect! I’ll need a few details from you so we can invoice the property correctly. Could you please send these details:
 
 Unit:

 Lease term:",,,,,
Incoming,Ok will send!,,,,,
Outgoing,The rebate will be sent when my company receives payment from Neo at Ten. That’s generally 60-90 days from today. It’s sent straight to your account using your phone number so no need for you to do anything. Neo at Ten pays 50% commission so your rebate will be 50% of the max amount. Your rebate will be $100 😊,,,,,

Incoming,I have one last question lol my unit has a balcony right?,,,,,
Outgoing,No balcony for the B1 unfortunately. That’s a big reason they’re that price. There’s a larger 2bed with a balcony that is $1448,,,,,
Incoming,I have A3,,,,,
Incoming,That was my purpose of getting 1st floor lol with balcony lol,,,,,
Outgoing,Sorry lol completely wrong apt im thinking of 😵‍💫. YES! You have a balcony,,,,,

Outgoing,"Hi Eddriane, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment! I just need to clarify a few things from your form submission. 
 
 How soon do you need to move? Do you have a lease ending or no lease?",,,,,
Incoming,Hey! Thanks for getting back with me! My current lease is ending on 9/10/24,,,,,
Outgoing,"Of course! Okay cool, and you’re looking to move closer to the city. Any areas in particular in mind?",,,,,
Incoming,"Yes, this traffic is killing me. I sit in 2 hours worth after work after day tryna get to Katy. No particular area, I just know I wanna be in or around the 610 loop. I work on Westheimer so anywhere near there is good.",,,,,
Outgoing,Oh no no no. I’ll send you some options. Is $1500 flexible or is that a strict budget?,,,,,
Incoming,"Strict for right now, until I find a better paying job. I’m currently paying $1360 that’s with all the fees and stuff added in and I’m pretty comfortable with that right now but I know moving closer up means an increase in rent. I just don’t wanna commit and put myself into a bind.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, got it. What days of the week are best for you to tour?",,,,,
Incoming,Monday and Tuesdays.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll send you some options in a bit and we can start setting up tours for the beginning of next week",,,,,
Incoming,"Sounds good, thank you!",,,,,
Outgoing,Absolutely!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour and I’ll set them up for Monday & Tuesday!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice).

Incoming,"Got it, would prefer if you came with; more comfortable. I’m at work until 4, will sit and look at them once I make it home.",,,,,
Outgoing,Sure thing. Okay sounds good,,,,,
Incoming,"Also, what do you mean by a free move?",,,,,
Outgoing,"The free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate because the move usually never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay a move deposit and many times you just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out.",,,,,
Incoming,"Okay, that makes sense.",,,,,
Incoming,"Had some free time..

Outgoing,"Thanks, same to you!",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey, sorry to brother; I’ve been seeing that we’re supposed to get bad weather Monday.. do you think we should reschedule the tours?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, no bother. No we should definitely keep them. If other people decide not to tour, even better for us. Want to get in as soon as we can because prices change without warning. We’re going to have the same weather Tuesday too",,,,,
Incoming,"Okay got it, see you then.",,,,,
Outgoing,See you then,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Eddriane, I didn’t realize by bad weather we were expecting a hurricane tomorrow. I think it would be best for us to reschedule. Looks like it’s going to be really bad",,,,,
Incoming,"Yeah, that’s fine. We can reschedule.",,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. I’ll schedule for next Monday,,,,,

 All under $1500 and running specials

Incoming,"I only liked Avasa, but it looks a little far out",,,,,
Incoming,"Well no, it isn’t. We can add it to the tour as well.",,,,,
Incoming,Allora Bear Creek as well,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, we’re good for Allora Bear Creek Monday @ 9:15am",,,,,

Incoming,"Good morning, and yes; will see you soon.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Liked “Good morning, and yes; will see you soon.”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Eddriane, wanted to check on you. Have you decided who you want to go with?",,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_6087.heic,,,,
Incoming,"Hey, are you partnered with any of these apartments?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Yea all of them besides Everly. Out of them all I’d say Alta Washington and Orleans at Fannin and maybe Pearl Woodlake would be worth a look. 
 
 Definitely not Providence uptown, Broadstone toscano is so so and District at green briar is a maybe
 
 Vargos on the lake is under $1300 over there next to 88Twenty also
 
 If you want the new look out of all of them I’d say Alta Washington for sure but they start in the $1400’s, were you thinking about increasing budget?",,,,,
Incoming,I’m thinking about increasing. The only two I really liked on our tour was Allora & Avasa; but they feel a little far out,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Yea I feel you on that. What would you increase to?,,,,,
Incoming,Okay. I can’t decide between Allora and Avasa,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, there are a few things you can consider. Allora will be better on price. Avasa has easier access to highways, you’d have a balcony if that matters to you. They’re pretty similar, I think Avasa is built a little better. Similar year build, similar reviews and generally both really good options",,,,,
Outgoing,Anything specifically about them you can’t choose between?,,,,,
Incoming,"Not really, I just really like them both if Allora is better in price I’d do that one. How much for that one again?",,,,,
Incoming,It’s just a little far out that I didn’t like,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, Allora is $1400 + 6 weeks free = $1238/mo self pro-rated. 
 
 Yea, that price in or around the galleria is tough right now for a new building. Sacrificing area a bit for the new building",,,,,
Outgoing,When did you plan on applying?,,,,,
Outgoing,The only one I can recommend closer is Coop Heights. They’re $1482 + 1 month free,,,,,
Outgoing,https://www.coopheights.com/,,,,,
Outgoing,"Brand new and would be closer to work. They have no amenities though. No pool, no gym",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know if you’d want to see them and I’ll set up a tour,,,,,
Incoming,Sorry. Just getting off. But we can apply tomorrow for Allora,,,,,
Outgoing,"No worries. Okay, let me know if you have any questions about the application.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also, when you begin the application you’ll come across the questions “how did you hear about us?”
 
 Please choose “Locator” from the dropdown exactly how you see in Yellow. That’s the only way Allora will link me as your referral 🙏🏼",,,,,
Outgoing,,IMG_0864.jpg,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, making sure you’re all set with your app?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Eddriane, checking in on you. Are you all good?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey, I haven’t applied yet. I’ve been looking for other options. I want the balcony",,,,,
Incoming,"But Allora is my top choice, just wish it had a balcony",,,,,
Outgoing,Have you looked into Westover at West Branch? Down the street from Allora. Built 2023. Units under $1500 with balconies,,,,,
Incoming,Any specials?,,,,,
Outgoing,1 month free,,,,,
Incoming,Allora still has the 6 weeks free? I can break up?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes. Yes, you can always break it up. Just remember most won’t break it up for you. You’ll just get the credit and it will be on you to break it up yourself each month",,,,,
Incoming,Is that same with Westover with the 1 month free?,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes,,,,,
Incoming,Can you give me like a price quote on both? I apologize,,,,,
Outgoing,"No worries…
 
 Allora Bear Creek
 $1420 + 6 weeks free = $1256/mo
 
 Westover at West Branch
 $1480 + 4 weeks free = $1366/mo
 
 Base rent for each",,,,,
Incoming,And that’s without the extra lil fees right?,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes,,,,,
Outgoing,Any word on how you want to move forward?,,,,,
Outgoing,Questioned “Any word on how you want to move forward?”,,,,,
Incoming,"Yes, Allora. I haven’t applied yet",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, just wanted to know you’re good. Prices continue to change as you wait also and their special can change at anytime when they feel they’ve leased enough units with it. Allora’s lowest price is now $1460 with only 1 unit at that price. Are you still waiting out to look for other units or something else have you waiting to apply?",,,,,

Incoming,Allorra went up on prices,,,,,
Incoming,"Unless, you have some new places with better deals?",,,,,
Outgoing,"No worries, Ashford is a really good deal. New with a good deal is Define Living Brittmore. Brand new, actually down the street from Avasa. Units at $1375 + 6 weeks free = $1216/mo. Also no app or admin fees right now",,,,,
Incoming,"Do you think it’s better than Ashford? I like Ashford because it’s all digital, and has parking garage, and it’s all inside; kinda like a hotel set up.",,,,,
Outgoing,It’s newer and all inside. There’s no parking garage though. Parking is gated but outside,,,,,
Incoming,Digital as well?,,,,,
Outgoing,Do you mean is everything key fob access?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes,,,,,
Incoming,Or like a code,,,,,
Outgoing,Both. There’s a physical key and a 4 digit passcode you can use to enter your unit. The entire perimeter is digital,,,,,

Outgoing,"Okay, yes 13 months. And I know max rent was $1500 before even though we found cheaper. Is it the same or has budget changed?",,,,,
Incoming,"Same price, if we’re able to find lower; ya know that’s perfectly fine with me lol. I would like to stay in the same areas that we’ve kinda looked at before.",,,,,
Outgoing,Got it lol. And that would mean where you’re at now and closer to the city right? Is downtown too central?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes where I am now.,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “Yes where I am now.”,,,,,
Outgoing,"But are areas like the galleria, heights, etc too central for you?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Eddriane, I’m going to run a search today. Are you looking to find your new place and be approved before submitting your 60 day notice or are we good to tour within 60 days of the move?",,,,,
Incoming,"Yes looking to be approved before submitting, just in case I get denied again.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Liked “Yes looking to be approved before submitting, just in case I get denied again.”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it, I’ll send some options today",,,,,
Incoming,Thank you.,,,,,
Outgoing,Happy to help 👌🏼,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good evening, I just emailed your list. Check spam if you don't see it. 
  
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Your move is a little further out than ideal for our search but let me know the options that really stand out I’ll keep my eye on them for tours!",,,,,

Incoming,Hey. Just checking in. I got the renewal letter from my current appointment. Do you think we can find something with these rates? Or something that includes maybe some specials I can break into the monthly payment.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Eddriane, let me take a quick look. Mandatory things are you’re definitely wanting a balcony, obviously washer/dryer. Anything else in particular?",,,,,
Incoming,"Nah, just those things honestly.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I just emailed you a few options. Truthfully, there isn’t much at or below that renewal rate price that I’d rush to move for. Take a look and let me know your thoughts. That price Ashford is giving you is a great price, but if you’re in a headspace where you’re dead set on moving just let me know and we’ll do all we can to get you moved into the right place!",,,,,
Incoming,"Okay. I will look in a second. I definitely get it. But man, after all the fee’s gets added, I’m paying close to $1,500 a month.",,,,,
Incoming,,PayNearMe -- Show.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,"So it’s like, if I know I can handle that; why not get more bank for my buck? I feel like at that price, I can get something way better than Ashford.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Mmmm, I see. How many square feet is your apt at Ashford?",,,,,
Incoming,688 I believe,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, so you be okay with paying around $1500 after all fees for something better",,,,,
Incoming,Yes,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll take another look when I get a chance to sit 👍🏼",,,,,
Incoming,Thank you so much!,,,,,
Outgoing,Absolutely!! I just add a few more. What are your thoughts about being downtown?,,,,,
Incoming,I’m okay with that,,,,,
Outgoing,1810 Main is a highrise downtown. That have a unit over 700 sqft for $1535 + 2 months free = $1298 per month,,,,,
Outgoing,https://www.1810mainapartments.com/1810-main-houston-tx/,,,,,
Outgoing,,,,,,
Incoming,Can we set up a viewing?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes, when works best for you?",,,,,
Outgoing,Note that gross monthly income needs to be at least $4605 per month for this unit,,,,,
Incoming,"Mm, I’m not sure if I meet that.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, we need to figure out what your gross monthly income is then. You’ll need to get approved on the market rate at all of these places before specials",,,,,
Incoming,"Okay, lemme know what you send you in order to figure it out",,,,,
Outgoing,Your pay stub for the last month will do if you have it,,,,,
Incoming,,RPT_-_Payslip_to_Print_-_Report_Design_-_Copy_08_13_2025.pdf,,,,
Incoming,Lemme know if that works,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes, based on this of they’re consistently the same every 2 weeks you can be approved for base rent of about $1370",,,,,
Outgoing,I’ll search again tomorrow for options that fall within that 👌🏼,,,,,
Outgoing,Good morning. I think we should see Co/op Farmers Market. It’s brand new in the heights. There’s a unit at $1249 - 628 sqft that you would qualify for. And another unit at $1348 - 688 sqft that you would qualify for. And they’re doing up to 2 months free,,,,,
Outgoing,Coopfarmersmarketapts.com,,,,,
Outgoing,… I don’t think they have any more units with balconies,,,,,
Outgoing,"There’s Co/op Heights that has a unit with a balcony though. They’re prime location, walking distance to HEB
 
 coopheights.com",,,,,
Outgoing,And last one… Caroline at Memorial. They’re brand new and 2 miles away from the Ashford. Best price is $1399 - 734 sqft. You’d still qualify because they only require 2.75x the rent. Running special up to 2 months free too,,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know which you want to check out 👌🏽,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Eddriane, any thoughts on the properties I sent?",,,,,
Incoming,"I honestly haven’t, my birthday was on the 16th. I’m currently on a trip in Jamaica, I come back tomorrow. I’ll sit and go through the list then.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “I honestly haven’t, my birthday was on the 16th. I’m currently on a trip in Jamaica, I come back tomorrow. I’ll sit and go through the list then.”",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey, how did everything go yesterday?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Eddriane, checking in again. How did everything go last week? Did any stand out or are we still looking?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey. Has any new complex’s became available? Wasn’t too impressed by those I saw. Only because they have like the same layout I already have. Kinda want something with some turns and twist, if that makes sense lol.",,,,,
Outgoing,Hey! Two that I would suggest are 55fifty northwest Crossing - they have a 837 sqft unit with a not so typical layout where you get an entry way that opens up to the living room. And also Timbergrove Station who normally I don’t think we could qualify for but their prices are reduced by a couple hundred dollars right now,,,,,
Incoming,Can we set up a viewing for both?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes, when works best for you?",,,,,
Incoming,"Can we the 22nd? That’s my next off day on a work day. Other else I’m off on the weekend, and I’m not sure if they have viewings on the weekends.",,,,,
Outgoing,A lot can change by then with prices. I think Saturday will be best to get in asap,,,,,
Incoming,"I’m not off Saturday, off sunday; can I do then?",,,,,
Outgoing,Sunday you can do Timbergrove Station. Then do 55fifty on the 22nd. Timbergrove I’m just afraid they’ll increase prices again soon so Sunday should work,,,,,
Incoming,"Okay perfect, thank you.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Of course! Here’s your schedule:
 
 Sunday, September 14
 1pm - Timbergrove Station
 
 Monday, September 22
 11am - 55fifty NW Crossing",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Andrea, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment! I just need to clarify a few things from your form submission. 
 
 How soon do you need to move? Do you have a lease ending or no lease?",,,,,
Incoming,Lease ending Nov but I want to move a month before cause it’s out of state,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay got it. Will you be visiting Houston to tour apartments in person? Do you have dates set to visit?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes I’m coming down aug22,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay perfect, do you know what areas you’d be interested in living?",,,,,
Incoming,"Heights,downtown them the only ones I know about lol not to far out tho from downtown",,,,,
Outgoing,Got you! Are you moving for work? Is there a work location you’re trying to stay close to?,,,,,
Incoming,no im moving for a fresh start,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay cool, is $2100 flexible at all or is that a strict budget?",,,,,
Incoming,Strict budget,,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it, I’ll send some options in a bit. Just keep in mind prices and availability change very often so this will be a general list not specific to your October move timeframe. In Texas we work on a 60-day notice system, so renters are required to submit a 60 day notice to vacate and that’s when their unit is put back on the market for me to see. That said, I’ll be searching again right before your trip. Aug22 will be the perfect time for you to come down and tour to make a decision 👍🏼",,,,,
Outgoing,"Just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling in August👍🏼
 
 Let me know your favorites ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll have them saved for Aug when you visit",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free 2 hour move (your choice). 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you.",,,,,
Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Incoming,"I was looking at Drewery place but I didn’t hear no good reviews about them saying it’s not safe crack head be all around and hot water be going out a lot.
 And fourth and navigation I luv but the rent was saying 2130",,,,,
Outgoing,"Drewery Place is really nice but not my personal favorite. I love fourth at navigation. They have their A4 floor plan… a 807 sqft unit for $1912 right now. Remember, these won’t have the availability for your move date right now. For the most part we’ll be able to see as far as September availability right now. We will have to revisit closer to when you tour for October availability. There may be some new buildings just opening by then too",,,,,
Incoming,Ok cause fourth and navigation was my favorite but the views of drewery is Wht got my attention,,,,,
Outgoing,"My favorites from your list in no particular order…
 
 Forth at Navigation
 Elev8
 The Laura
 Modera Waugh
 The Travis
 
 Drewery is really nice, don’t get me wrong. It’s one you’ll want to see in person to get the feel. And be cautious of what you’re seeing on IG/tiktok. The units shown with the price are rarely the actual unit. Common marketing tactic in the apartment industry. If you see something on someone’s page, just send it to me and I’ll let you know what it is",,,,,
Incoming,https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNA1GbLs/,,,,,
Outgoing,That’s Drewery Place,,,,,
Incoming,Awe,,,,,
Outgoing,Hey Andrea! Reaching out to make sure you’re still set to visit Aug22nd? We should start to set up tours in the next week so we have no problems with tour availability,,,,,
Outgoing,Also one more to take a look at is Tempo at White Oak. It’ll be similar finishes to Forth at Navigation and will be opening for first move ins around Oct/Nov,,,,,
Outgoing,https://www.tempoatwhiteoak.com/,,,,,
Incoming,Naw I pushed it back til September,,,,,
Outgoing,"Aw man okay, when you figure out the dates just let me know. We’ll get you set up to see all of your best options while you’re here",,,,,
Incoming,Okay I’m working on my credit so I won’t have any problems,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, most apts will be looking for a 600 or higher. If you’re above that with sufficient rental history and income you should be more than ok",,,,,
Outgoing,,Audio Message.caf,,,,
Incoming,My favorite is looking like fourth at navigation but I’m kinda looking for a townhouse as well,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Have you seen a virtual tour of the units at Forth at Nav yet?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes,,,,,
Outgoing,Perfect. I’ll be here if you need anything. Please let me know what you end up deciding,,,,,
Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Incoming,If u come across some townhouses can u let me know,,,,,
Outgoing,Same budget of $2100 with a central location near downtown?,,,,,
Incoming,It don’t have to be downtown,,,,,
Outgoing,What areas are you okay with?,,,,,
Incoming,Spring are any nice area not flood zone,,,,,
Outgoing,Check out Yardly Cypress. Private townhomes generally won’t be in our budget if they’re newer & updated. These are private small houses and there are 2 bedrooms within budget. They’re in Cypress,,,,,

Incoming,It’s not urgent right now I’ve been trying to get my daughter all moved in that’s why I been all over the place but I am interested in a townhouse tho.the ones u send was cool if I go up on my budget would it help me get something nice and updated,,,,,
Outgoing,Gotcha. Private townhomes new and updated you would need to increase budget maybe $200 or so. For apartments your budget is fine. I still like Forth at navigation for the space you get. Their A4 - 807 sqft is in the $1900’s,,,,,
Outgoing,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CdgTmz1Dtiw/?igsh=N2hxOHB1a2JmMHY=,,,,,
Incoming,Would a king bed fit in there tho,,,,,
Outgoing,I’d say so. We can always check with the leasing agent but measurements for the bedroom are 10’10” x 10’10”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good evening Andrea, I’ll be by Forth at Navigation tomorrow to show you around. What time zone are you in?",,,,,
Incoming,Central,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll be by around 1:30pm. I’ll text before I call but will be able to show you the building, amenities, unit, and surroundings via FaceTime",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Andrea, would you be able to tour today at 12:30 instead of 1:30?",,,,,
Incoming,Yes,,,,,
Outgoing,Perfect. I’ll text first,,,,,

Outgoing,Lol got it. I love hearing reasons why one over the other… what’s yours?,,,,,
Outgoing,Unit itself?,,,,,
Incoming,It’s just not as luxury as fourth,,,,,
Incoming,Just ok nothing that gives u the wow factor,,,,,
Outgoing,Got it. I know everybody has their person preferences. I’m a fan of Forth too. I think you’ll love it there,,,,,
Outgoing,I will say that prices for that A4 at Forth are that price because they have 5+ available. Price could go up once they lease one. Something to think about if you wanted to lock in a unit at the current price while you continue to search for a townhome,,,,,
Incoming,Okay I’m trying to make sure my credit score where it needs to be,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, generally you’ll be fine above 600. Some cases apartments look for above 650 but still consider all factors (rental & background history, income, credit)",,,,,

Incoming,It say 6 weeks free,,,,,
Outgoing,"It’s “up to” 6 weeks free on select units. That’s a look & lease special meaning when you apply within 24 hours of touring and when you move in before 9/30
 
 For October move ins the special is 4 weeks",,,,,

Incoming,"Good morning. I’m looking to move in August, middle or end. No lease.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, will you be visiting to tour apartments in person or applying after only virtual tours?",,,,,
Incoming,No I’m coming to visit to tour in person. Next week or the week after,,,,,
Incoming,"I’m looking for something in the city. Downtown, heights, river oaks. I would like to have floor to ceiling windows, with a big kitchen island, and light finishes. Budget is $21-2200.",,,,,

Outgoing,"Okay, got it. I’ll send the best options within budget and we’ll go from there!",,,,,
Incoming,Sounds good! Thank you a bunch,,,,,
Incoming,One last thing i forgot to mention i have a toy poodle so pet friendly please,,,,,
Outgoing,Got it! My pleasure,,,,,
Outgoing,"Just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 A few of my favorites from the list for you: Elev8, Forth at Navigation, The Travis
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and when you figure out when you’ll be in town, I’ll have them scheduled!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you",,,,,
Incoming,"I’m looking now thank you so much. I’m interested in Bowen River Oaks, Drewrey Place, Elev8, & the Southmoee",,,,,
Incoming,I wanted to know if these particular units have a bath & shower. Ore just 1.,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “I’m looking now thank you so much. I’m interested …”,,,,,
Outgoing,"I believe… Southmore will be a bath, Drewery place will be a shower, Bowen A3 is a bath/A13 is a shower, Elev8 A2 is a bath/A3 is a shower. 
 
 Do you have a preference?",,,,,
Incoming,"I would prefer a bath for sure. I really like Bowen River oaks & Drewery place , & Southmore the most. One of them had a bath & a shower in the pics that would be awesome if i could get a unit like that within budget but that may be a lot to ask for",,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Prices and specials could change by the time you visit for better or for worst so it’s not out of the question. When you decide on dates to visit just let me know and I’ll start coordinating tours. If you have any questions in the meantime time don’t hesitate to reach out!,,,,,
Incoming,When is best to tour for you? During the week or the weekend?,,,,,
Outgoing,If this month it’ll be during the week. Next month I’m pretty free,,,,,
Incoming,Okay well let’s just do August 1st & the 2nd,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Okay well let’s just do August 1st & the 2nd”,,,,,
Outgoing,That sounds perfect,,,,,
Outgoing,I’ll start scheduling tours next week,,,,,
Incoming,Okay thank you. And send more of anything else that you see because you did a great job with these so far!,,,,,
Outgoing,My pleasure. I sure will!,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “My pleasure. I sure will!”,,,,,
Incoming,"Good morning! Just checking to make sure we’re all good for Thursdays tours? Also, i want to add fort navigation to the list. I actually like that one at a lot but all of the units i saw had a shower, preferably, I would like a bath",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good afternoon! Yes we’re all good for Thursday, I’ll send the schedule over by tomorrow. And okay sounds perfect, I love Forth. I’ll see if any units will have a bath",,,,,
Incoming,Perfect. And anything else you find just lmk,,,,,
Outgoing,Will do!,,,,,
Incoming,Are there any more spots that have that marble kitchen look?,,,,,
Outgoing,"There were a couple from our original list. Like Novel River Oaks and Aris Market Square who have the marble look for some units but they’ve fallen out of our price range since then. I think the options we have in mind are the best to stay within budget. At the moment we’ll be seeing:
 
 Bowen River Oaks
 Drewery Place
 The Southmore
 ELEV8
 Forth at Navigation
 
 The Laura East River is a client favorite as well. One more to consider",,,,,
Incoming,Perfect I’ll look into these. Thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,"Absolutely, my pleasure",,,,,
Incoming,Hey ashanti! Can schedule Bowen for 1:30 or 2 pm?,,,,,
Outgoing,Hey! 12pm is all they have for Thursday & Friday. The others are pretty wide open. Do you have a preference for the rest of them?,,,,,
Incoming,"I called them & told them I’ll be flying in around that time, they were able to move it to 3pm. Is that okay with you?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes, no issues there",,,,,
Outgoing,Do you want no tours before then on Thursday?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes we can tour before then. I get in at 12:40 that’s why i said 12 won’t work bc it’s cutting it close,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, got it. I’ll squeeze one in at 2pm and save the others for Friday",,,,,
Incoming,Okay perf. Sounds good!,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Okay perf. Sounds good!”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Here’s the final schedule:
 
 Thursday, Aug 1st
 2pm - The Southmore
 3pm - Bowen River Oaks
 
 Friday Aug 2nd
 12pm - Elev8
 1pm - The Laura
 2pm - Forth at Navigation
 3pm - Drewery Place 
 
 Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Looking at availability again, The Southmore unfortunately is no longer in budget. Best price they have is now $2592 available Sep 11th. Do you want to scratch that tour?",,,,,
Incoming,Is the Southmore the one in the medical center?,,,,,
Incoming,& yes this schedule looks perfect,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “& yes this schedule looks perfect ”,,,,,
Incoming,Okay that’s far anyway. So whatever. My favs rn are Bowen & fourth. I’m pretty sure ima choose one out of those 2 honestly,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, sounds good. I personally think you’ll love Forth best🤞🏼",,,,,
Incoming,I agree. Let’s see! My friend said Bowen is perf & is right by the galleria & target,,,,,
Incoming,But I’m obsessed w forth’s marble,,,,,
Outgoing,True. Bowen might win the location. I just think you’ll love the units at forth. We’ll see!,,,,,
Incoming,We will! I’m excited,,,,,
Outgoing,Emphasized “We will! I’m excited ”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Constance, making sure we’re all set for Bowen at 3pm?",,,,,
Incoming,Hi! I was just about to text you. Yes we’re all set,,,,,
Outgoing,Sounds good! See you there,,,,,
Outgoing,,IMG_0955.jpg,,,,
Outgoing,Good afternoon! Making sure we’re good for 2pm at Forth?,,,,,
Incoming,Hey Ashanti! I don’t want to see it anymore I’m really set on the location of Bowen😭😭,,,,,
Outgoing,Lol all good if that’s how you feel! If you feel that strongly it’s time to apply like Nowww. When were you planning on submitting your app?,,,,,
Incoming,I agree. & when i get back home Monday,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, well weekends are when the most apps get submitted and we’re wanting one specific unit #1513. If that gets taken, you’re left with one in October and if that goes we’re out of options. I’d highly suggest applying today. Even if you need to do it with your mom on FT",,,,,
Outgoing,…just my suggestion. I see people miss out everyday 😕,,,,,
Incoming,Okay well I’ll call her on FaceTime then. I asked Mia if there’s anything a little bigger than that one at all that will be available soon too,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay. For other units on notice, they would be available October or later unfortunately, or you’d be hoping someone breaks their lease",,,,,
Incoming,Ugh okay. Is there any other apartments in that area you think I’d like within budget?,,,,,
Outgoing,Only two I’d say Grey House River Oaks which is attached to River Oaks District or The Hayworth which is down San Felipe (walking distance to Trader Joe’s & Whole Foods),,,,,
Outgoing,For the exact area though we could check out Grey House,,,,,
Incoming,Let me look them up online,,,,,
Outgoing,Ok,,,,,
Incoming,Def not crazy about grey house,,,,,
Outgoing,"I figured. It’s what’s comparable in the exact area. Alexan River Oaks is definitely in budget also, with larger units",,,,,
Incoming,Wow these don’t give lol,,,,,
Incoming,Okay so Bowen it is,,,,,
Outgoing,Lol im sorry. You really don’t want to wait if your mind is made up. Thats how you’ll get stuck looking into other areas,,,,,
Incoming,For sure & i looked up forth area & that just don’t give at all omg lmaoooo,,,,,
Outgoing,Lmao I’m sorryy. You’re really big on area which is the hurdle. There’s only one River Oaks in Houston 😩,,,,,
Incoming,Lmaoooo i am. Cus everything i do is around there even before i was moving. Its close to all the clubs lounges & everything 😩,,,,,
Outgoing,"Lol I understand. Look, you’re going to move in, get comfortable, and you’re going to love it. It’s your first Highrise in a great location",,,,,
Incoming,Agreed! Def gonna apply tmrw tho,,,,,
Outgoing,Emphasized “Agreed! Def gonna apply tmrw tho”,,,,,
Incoming,Good morning. I’m ready to apply now,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_4522.PNG,,,,
Incoming,So how do we do the prorated amount?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay great, please remember to choose “locator” from the referral drop down, very important. The proration will be upon move in when your account is credited with the special. It won’t show right now",,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_4524.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,Yes I gotcha!,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved an image,,,,,
Outgoing,Thanks!,,,,,
Outgoing,Hey Constance! Wanted to check in to see if Bowen got back to you on your app yet?,,,,,

Incoming,Hi! Happy new year to you as well! It’s great. I really love it there I knew it was the perfect place for me. Love the location & the staff. Very lowkey which i like. I was concerned about it being mixey w a lot of young ppl but it’s just the opposite,,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Kandisse! its Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment. I just need to clarify a few things from your form submission. 
 
 How soon do you need to move? Do you have a lease ending or no lease?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey, my current lease ends August 16th. I saw an apartment on the site called Royal Spring that I toured recently & love. The prices on the site are much more cheaper than what they quoted me… assuming you all have some sort of deal with the complex. I am very much interested in working with you to get this affordable rate.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, how many bedrooms are you looking for and what rate were you looking to stay under?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey, just a 1 bedroom. I’d like to stay under $1200 if I can help it.",,,,,
Outgoing,,IMG_0653.PNG,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, you’re probably looking at the rate plus all the fees. The best price for your move date will be for unit 837 for $1180. That’s base rent. Here is the rent amount after all monthly fees. Is that price fine for you?",,,,,
Outgoing,Are you looking to apply to Royal Spring or are you still open to other suggestions under $1200?,,,,,
Incoming,I really like it so I think I’m going to apply next week Friday,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, just a heads up that prices can change on a daily basis so they could very well change by next Friday. Any concern in particular that you’re wanted to wait on?",,,,,
Incoming,"Just wanted to wait until pay day, so that if anything needs to be paid I can move forward quickly.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Understood. Well when you apply please select locator/realtor as your referral source. You’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice) for doing that. 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start your app and I’ll guide you",,,,,
Incoming,Okay sounds good. Thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,My pleasure,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good afternoon Kandisse, checking in on you. Are you still holding up on Royal Spring or have you already applied?",,,,,
Incoming,"I apologize for the delay in response. Are you able to send me a list of apartments in the spring area around $1200 range please. I’m currently familiar with the 77090 area, and my work place is around 77069. I’m open to the Spring, Texas area.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, no worries. Sure, I’d love to know what you’ve run into though. Royal Spring is in Spring and within budget. Any reason you’re no longer looking into them?",,,,,
Incoming,"I saw this place online called The Tribute that I thought looked cute based on the pictures, and it’s ranging a little bit less starting around $1100. I’m just trying to find the most affordable thing for me in a good area. I love the Royal Spring, but I have time in between to look around. Do you have any information on them by chance?",,,,,
Outgoing,"The Tribute was built in 2002 so will be old. Royal Spring was built in 2020
 
 Here are your best options:
 Under $1200
 Royal Spring 
 Birchway Spring Cypress
 Magnolia at Spring
 Savannah Oaks
 Evolve Champions
 
 Under $1300
 Park on Napoli
 The Mill Apartments
 The 
 
 These will be the best price while still being newer buildings. I know it may be hard to choose but last thing I want is for what is available to be leased and you be stuck having to settle for something you don’t love. Many have specials too, let me know if you have questions about how specials work. These prices will increase also as people lease",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know which you want to tour this weekend and please let me be the one to schedule. Apartments sometimes require me to be the first contact.,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “The Tribute was built in 2002 so will be old. Roya…”,,,,,
Incoming,Okay I’ll look at them when I get off of work. Thank you,,,,,
Incoming,I really love the Evolve Champions,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “I really love the Evolve Champions ”,,,,,

Outgoing,Good morning. Ok sounds good,,,,,

 Let me know if you have any questions or I can help at all! I’ll be here if you need me",,,,,
Incoming,Okay perfect!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Kandisse, just checking on you. Did everything go well with your application?",,,,,
Incoming,Hey! Yes I’m about to move in like next week. I put your name down on everything. Porsha had asked for your info again so I provided that to her.,,,,,

Outgoing,Okay no problem! I’ll send some options tonight,,,,,
Incoming,"Ok ok, perfect, thank you so much",,,,,

 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up any virtual tours - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Keep in mind prices you see do not include specials (Ex. 1 month free) and can reduce monthly rent. 
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to virtually tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Incoming,"Hello Ashanti, sorry I hadn't answered, I was looking at the apartments at this time and there is one that I really like, I also wanted to tell you that the date would be earlier, for the first of September, do you think it is possible?",,,,,
Outgoing,"No worries, I saw your favorites. Are you most interested in Prose District West and Allora District West? Yes, September 1st is definitely possible",,,,,
Incoming,I am more interested in Allora district West,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll get you some videos this weekend",,,,,

Outgoing,"Okay great, are you ready to apply? And have you decided on September 1st for your move date?",,,,,
Incoming,Yes I am ready for it and also yes September 1st for the move in date,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, best price will be $1259 with a move in date of September 12. Does that work?",,,,,
Incoming,Uhmm how much would it change if the move in date would be the 1st,,,,,
Outgoing,Right now it would be $1314 and that is for a date of either 8/17 or 9/7,,,,,
Outgoing,If you’re set on Sep 1st I can get in touch tomorrow to see if the date can be manually input,,,,,
Incoming,"I would really appreciate it if it can be manually input for the 1st, however, if it cannot be possible I’ll chose one of those two dates",,,,,
Incoming,I’m so sorry that bothering you with this Ashanti,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll follow up with you tomorrow. It’s no bother at all. I’m happy to be able to help",,,,,

Outgoing,My pleasure!,,,,,
Incoming,Le encantó “My pleasure!”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good afternoon Rebeca, I haven’t been able to get in touch with the office yet today. I’ll try until they close today at 5pm and we can apply then if we still haven’t had any luck. If they can manually change the move date, they will whether we wait on an answer or not",,,,,
Incoming,Oh okay so after 5 pm I can still apply? Even if we don’t have an answer yet,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes you can,,,,,
Incoming,Okay perfect in that case let me know and we will apply today thank you Ashanti,,,,,
Outgoing,Will do. My pleasure,,,,,
Incoming,Le encantó “Will do. My pleasure ”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Just spoke to the office and we are good to apply. 
 
 A few things to note. You will be getting 6 weeks free rent for your special and they change a bit based on the date you choose. Special will be given as [2 weeks free, each month for the first three months] Here are the details below
 
 Choose 8/25 - 6 weeks free starts in September so upon move in you will need to pay prorated amount for August (6 days) and 2 weeks of rent for September. You will receive a $500 gift card. And your app & admin fees ($200) will be credited back to you upon move in. 
 
 Choose 8/26-8/31 - 6 weeks free starts in October so upon move in you will need to pay prorated amount for August, and full month of rent for September. You will receive a $500 gift card. And your app & admin fees ($200) will be credited back to you upon move in. 
 
 Choose 9/1 - 6 weeks free starts in October so upon move in you will need to pay full month of rent for September. Your app & admin fees ($200) will be credited back to you upon move in. But you will NOT receive a $500 gift card
 
 
 Sorry if it’s a lot to look at. Simply put, moving in 8/25 will make your up front costs less and moving in 9/1 you will miss out on a free $500 gift card. Let me know what you decide and if you have any questions.",,,,,
Incoming,So what if I put the move in for 8/25 and just ask the office to pick up the keys on 09/01,,,,,
Outgoing,That’s totally fine.,,,,,
Incoming,Okay so let’s do it with the 8/25 then,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, use this link to apply. I think the furthest you’ll be allowed to choose is 8/18 so just choose that and we will have the office change the date to the 25th. You’ll want to apply for unit 0613",,,,,
Outgoing,https://alloradistrictwest.com/floorplan/a1/,,,,,
Outgoing,"Anywhere on the application you see the question “How did you hear about us?” Or “Who referred you?” Or “Referred by?”
 
 Please choose Locator/Realtor and add my name and company where applicable (Ashanti with AptAmigo)",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know throughout if you have any questions at all!,,,,,
Incoming,Absolutely,,,,,
Incoming,I’m gonna start in a few minutes if I see something I will let you know,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay sounds great,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Rebeca, just wanted to check on you. Were you able to submit yesterday, no problems?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hello Ashanti , I am so sorry I didn’t respond you back yesterday I finished the application really late during the night and didn’t want to bother you more lol",,,,,
Incoming,However I managed to do it all I’m just waiting for the paystubs for my roommate and the application will be done and also I did put you as a referral,,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Alexus, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment. Just a couple details so I know exactly what you’re looking for!
 
 What areas or neighborhoods are you considering?",,,,,
Incoming,"I will be new to the Houston area. I’m born and raised in Chicago. I have a 3 year old son. Just want an area he can play and grow up in. A place with modern, and stainless steel, spacious with granite counter top, and hopeful a unit with washer and dryer. What areas do you recommend",,,,,
Outgoing,"Katy, Cypress, and Humble are areas you can look into. Katy isd is known to be a great school district. 
 
 So you’ll be visiting September 13, when do you plan on moving?",,,,,
Incoming,Well we can start there and yes September 13. And maybe October 1 or whenever I find something,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, sounds good. I got your budget as $1800 for 2 bedroom is that correct? Is that flexible at all or a strict budget?",,,,,
Incoming,1500-1800. I’m even willing to consider a 1 bedroom if it’s spacious enough but 1800,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay got it! I’ll send you some options in a bit,,,,,
Incoming,Thank you,,,,,
Incoming,Bc currently my son is 3 but he still sleeps with me. Just need room for his toys,,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it. I just emailed your list. I added all 2 bedrooms. Keep in mind prices are without an applicable specials (Ex. 1 month free)
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling when you come next month👍🏽
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you’d want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll keep them on our radar!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate. 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you",,,,,
Incoming,Okay thank you. I would love to refer you and work with you. Been following you for a year just for the time of me ready to transition from Chicago to Houston,,,,,
Outgoing,My pleasure. And yes I’d love to work with anyone you know looking to move. We’ll get you into the right place,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “My pleasure. And yes I’d love to work with anyone …”,,,,,

Outgoing,Loved “Look forward to working with you ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Looking forward to the same!,,,,,
Incoming,Also can you share the things you need for me in order to transition and go thru with moving from Chicago to Houston,,,,,
Outgoing,Well these are the general requirements for approval. You’d apply after finding the apartment you want to go with and after you’re approved you just pick up keys from the office on your move date. Pretty straight forward. You will need to determine if you’ll be shipping your things and find a company to ship everything for you,,,,,

Incoming,Loved “Well these are the general requirements for approv…”,,,,,
Incoming,Thank you and I’m really starting over. Maybe a few of my son’s cars but I may leave those with my mom for the summer. But most likely staring over,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course. If you won’t be bringing much you just make your way to Houston on your move in day. You can pick up keys on or any day after your move in day during business hours,,,,,
Incoming,Thank you,,,,,

Incoming,Deals for what?,,,,,
Incoming,Do it cost to be shown the places or what?,,,,,
Outgoing,I’ll be sending the best deals under your budget of $1800 for you to see when you visit. And no it’s 100% free. No charges or changes to your lease. Please just refer me on the application and the property you choose will credit me for the referral.,,,,,

Incoming,Do you see the ones I favorite,,,,,
Incoming,I like those,,,,,
Outgoing,"Of course. And yes I see, I’ll have those set up for next Friday when you land and I’ll still look this week for others. Prices can change daily so I just want to make sure you have the most updated prices and availability when you’re here to tour",,,,,
Outgoing,Are you still looking to be moved in October?,,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Alexus, I hope you’re ready for your trip! I added a few more options to your list. 
 
 Some that stand out are Alta Spring Cypress, Grove East (2 bedrooms under $1600). Just to name a couple. 
 
 I see you favorited The Peri on Westheimer also, I wouldn’t recommend them. They look much better online than they do in person. 
 
 So far we’ll have Lenox Katy Crossing and Premier Katy scheduled for Friday. Let me know which others you’d like to schedule!",,,,,

Outgoing,"Okay perfect, I’ll start scheduling",,,,,
Incoming,Thank you,,,,,
Incoming,What’s a rebate again. I remember you mentioning I’ll get a $200 rebate,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes $200. It’ll be sent via Zelle from my company for working with us,,,,,
Incoming,Wow that’s what’s up. Never worked with a company who is so generous. This will actually be my 2nd apartment. I been in my current apartment going on 4 yrs,,,,,
Outgoing,"Definitely helpful to offset some of those move in fees. Okay nicee, I’ll have everything set up when you’re here. There will be 6 tours in total. I’ll do 4 Friday and 2 more on Saturday 👌🏼",,,,,
Incoming,Thank you. Are the ones Friday close to each other or all in Katy,,,,,
Incoming,How far is Katy from Houston again?,,,,,
Incoming,How much are usually move in fees,,,,,
Incoming,That’s the same as an deposit right,,,,,
Outgoing,"Friday they’re close to each other in Katy and Cypress. Saturday will be NW Houston and Humble. 
 
 Katy is about 35 mins from Downtown Houston with no traffic. Everything you’d be commuting to for the most part is in between there. 
 
 Move in fees you’ll usually have Application & Admin fees upfront. App is generally $75-125. Admin fees are about $150-200 give or take. Deposit is seperate and generally a couple hundred but can be more depending on your screening. Deposit is generally not due until after you’re approved",,,,,
Incoming,Ok Thank you so much. You have been very helpful,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course. Happy I can help!,,,,,

Outgoing,Happy to help! We could add The Ryon. They have 2 bedrooms for $1799 + 6 weeks free which would bring rent to about $1591/month,,,,,
Outgoing,www.livetheryonapts.con,,,,,

Incoming,The link didn’t open,,,,,
Outgoing,Www.livetheryonapts.com,,,,,
Incoming,How do the rent go down,,,,,
Outgoing,You’d self pro-rate the special. Meaning rather than use the whole 6 weeks free at once and not pay rent for that time. You spread the special across your entire lease which brings monthly rent down,,,,,
Outgoing,"And okay! We can play by ear, let me know if you’ll be needing to adjust!",,,,,

Outgoing,"Of course. Yes understood, we’ll get you into the right place! Let me know if you’d like to add The Ryon (I think you should)",,,,,
Incoming,Can you send link again. I couldn’t open the other one for Ryon. And also is it kid friendly. Like neighborhood wise,,,,,
Outgoing,http://www.livetheryonapts.com,,,,,
Outgoing,"I’d say for it to be on the outskirts it has a convenient location and kid friendly amenities like the pool. Across the street is a shopping center (gym, salon, Kroger, ulta, 5below, Walgreens, plenty of food options, Michael’s, home goods, etc). Taekwondo down the street. Just lots of businesses nearby",,,,,
Incoming,Okay great what time you think we can set that for. After the 12pm?,,,,,
Outgoing,"I’ll check times and get back to you, they have all of Saturday blocked out right now",,,,,
Incoming,Okay thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,The Ryon is scheduled for Saturday @1:30pm with Cynthia. They’re fully booked Saturday so we’d have to be on time for that one for sure,,,,,
Incoming,Ok thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course!,,,,,
Outgoing,Hey Alexus! I hope you’ve made it in safely and ready to tour. I wanted to update you that Premier at Katy is no longer working with locators so for them only we won’t be able to offer the $200 rebate. You’re still welcome to tour them but wanted you to be informed,,,,,
Incoming,Ok can I come to cypress early,,,,,
Incoming,I’m here,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, yes sure you can. You may be waiting behind scheduled tours but offices are generally good about taking you in early if they aren’t completely swamped with back to back tours",,,,,

Outgoing,Lenox for the big 1 bed (A7 - $1575) and Prose for the 2 bed (B1 - $1699). It depends on which layout you like best. Both great deals but Lenox if you like that big living space and price is great,,,,,

 But the apartments aren’t enclosed completely. When you step out of your unit, it’s kind of a breezeway.",,,,,
Incoming,Is this something I may not like? Did the other ones have a breeze way? I’m trying to think about which apartment it may be similar to,,,,,
Outgoing,You’ll just feel the weather of the day when you walk out of your unit. The hallways aren’t enclosed air conditioned hallways,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Alexus, are you all set for options? Any questions I can answer?",,,,,
Incoming,Hey what area was west end apartment in again,,,,,
Outgoing,That’s Richmond,,,,,
Incoming,I like how it was around like a well established neighborhood. All the stores. Is there another apartment complex that are similar. I like them but I feel as if the 1 bedroom apartment could be more spacious for what they asking for?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Over 900sqft in the$1600’s and over 1,000sqft in the $1700’s are outstanding prices really. At a new building too. If you like the area I think it’s the right choice",,,,,

Incoming,Hey I’ll be back in Houston 17-21. I loved west end but something just couldn’t make me commit. I love the area how busy it is and have stores etc. I loved the amenities etc. maybe imma have to see it again or something. I don’t know why I can’t commit,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, okay cool. Anything you need to make sure you’re 100% on your decision",,,,,
Outgoing,You just going to want to see West End again or others too?,,,,,
Incoming,I think I really like it was well established. Reminded me of home and didn’t feel isolated or secluded. If there are other units that have that feel with a well established neighborhood and work with my price range that would be great. I wouldn’t mind looking at them,,,,,
Outgoing,"Got you. I would say for West End that they’re running 8 weeks free right now and I’d hate for the special to change or go away in the next week and a half. Something to consider is putting your app in so you lock in price and special and if you’re really not sold when you tour again you have no obligation to lease. It can be hard to find 1 bedrooms that reach 1,000 sqft at all, let alone at the price + the special. Prices and specials can change at any moment. Just something to think about",,,,,
Incoming,Hello can you set up west end again for around 12:30-1pm. I land 9am but I have to pick up my rental,,,,,

Outgoing,"Okay great. You’re in the system, they should be all ready for you for 11:30. If you have any questions/concerns just call or text me!",,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “Okay great. You’re in the system, they should be a…”",,,,,
Outgoing,Good morning! ☀️ How did everything go yesterday?,,,,,
Incoming,Great. She showed me 2. The 1 bedroom on the 2nd floor and another 1 bedroom that’s the same price with a study. I’m more interested in the 1 bedroom. The one with the study look cramped and smaller although they both had the same square feet,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Great. She showed me 2. The 1 bedroom on the 2nd f…”,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay perfect. Are you keeping your options open for other places or going to decide on West End?,,,,,
Outgoing,… let me know if you want to see others while you’re here. I’ll send a few for you to check out,,,,,
Outgoing,,Audio Message.caf,,,,
Incoming,Hey I’m feeling ok. I kinda feel like west end is it but if you have other apartments that meet my requirements and price range and in a busy strip like west end please send over,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, what about them has you feeling iffy?",,,,,
Incoming,Seeing if I could finally a 2 bedroom for $1599 with still have open space and modern and stainless steal appliances with granite countertops. I know I see Katy but I kinda didn’t like how secluded it was,,,,,
Incoming,If you get what I’m saying,,,,,
Incoming,West end have more stores etc,,,,,
Outgoing,"Got you got you. I’ll see what I can find for the price point. The biggest issue is going to be space, having that open living space with 2 rooms. But let me take a look today 👌🏼",,,,,
Incoming,Ok thank you. Katy space was decent. Just didn’t like the secluded ness,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Got you got you. I’ll see what I can find for the …”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good evening, sorry for the late message. I’m really trying to look and West End is really looking like the best option for a few reasons. Because of the area around is lively like you want and you get the big living space. 
 
 I’m finding 2 bedrooms but the issue is area (more secluded) and the living rooms area is smaller compared to the 1 bedrooms at West End. 
 
 So we need to figure out if having that 2nd bedroom is a deal breaker. Do you only want to consider 2 bedrooms or are you still liking the one beds as well?",,,,,
Incoming,I understand. If you have any suggestions before a final decision please send over,,,,,
Incoming,Have you ever heard of parkline,,,,,
Incoming,https://parklineapts.com/virtual-tours/,,,,,
Incoming,What part of Houston would this area be consist of,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “I understand. If you have any suggestions before a…”,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes. It’s along the tollway and not exactly as lively an area but will be really nice. First move-ins aren’t until January though,,,,,
Incoming,Omggggg I need to make a decision but don’t want to rush but I’m so ready to leave and commit to it. But want it to be a great fit for my son and I. Anxiety getting to me. Between prose and west end. I feel like prose I’ll get my bang for my buck with 2 bedrooms for 1699$ but it’s not a lot of lively hood such as stores etc. west end is nice and the bedroom could be just enough until I get my feet wet but they want $1599 for 1 bedroom 😭🤦🏽‍♀️,,,,,
Incoming,I’m not liking this. Ashanti help mee,,,,,
Outgoing,"Lol…I think you’ll be happy at both places. They each have pros and cons but you have to determine the day to day lifestyle and if you think you’ll feel like you need two bedrooms midway through your lease. 
 
 I think West End will be more convenient with all the stores nearby but that second bedroom may be nice to have especially with your boy grown a year by the time it’s time to move again. 
 
 Me personally, I say give yourself some space to be with your own thoughts at times. Having your own room to be in when you want. That’s just me 🤷🏽‍♂️",,,,,
Incoming,I see prose has 3 other locations. Any one of them areas like west end or no,,,,,
Incoming,Any other nice apartments in Richmond other than west end that’s equivalent to what prose asking for with 2 bedrooms,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Lol…I think you’ll be happy at both places. They e…”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Prose South Main will be the closest to the city. So less than 10 minutes away from the “inner-loop” which is closer to downtown Houston. Except for Prose Hard Yards which is actually Downtown and 2 bedroom is $1868 + 2 months free. 
 
 There are a few 2 bedrooms I’d still say are good options. Some we had on the list but missed the tours for initially…
 
 Alta Cypress Springs - 2 bed $1655
 Fidelis Cypress Creek - 2 bed $1699",,,,,
Incoming,Good morning I was looking at Alta cypress before you mentioned it last night. Can I do a tour of their 2 bedrooms and know what they offered as far as how long the hold a unit and how many weeks free,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes, you’re still in town able to tour today?
 
 They’re special is $500 look & lease (touring and applying within 48 hours) and 4-6 weeks free. And they can hold units for 2 weeks",,,,,
Incoming,I’m not in Houston no more I left Monday🤦🏽‍♀️ they can only hold for 2 weeks😭 at least west end was 60 days,,,,,
Incoming,Was prose 60 days too or im getting them mixed up ?,,,,,
Outgoing,"They’re new properties with a good amount of availability so I’m sure they can be flexible. 
 
 Prose shows 30 days but I’m thinking they can be flexible. I can confirm today",,,,,
Incoming,Ok is there a virtual with cypress. I went online and didn’t see one,,,,,
Incoming,Thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,This will be the actual floor plan (without the yard if not on the first floor),,,,,

Incoming,Any white cabinets,,,,,
Outgoing,Not white but they have a lighter theme. Looks like this…,,,,,
Outgoing,,Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 1.37.26 PM.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,Loved an image,,,,,
Incoming,I’m interested can you find out the information for cypress. I know specials change during weekends. Can you find out what they can do for someone like myself that’s trying to relocate. Like how long they can hold a unit especially if I’m Considering December. Just trying to make sure my money and transition is smoother,,,,,
Incoming,"Also I know you mention that $200
 Rebate is no longer considered",,,,,
Outgoing,"The office is going to reach out to you in a second to send you some info
 
 Units can be held for 60 days and the special is 6 weeks free (plus $1000 off if you look & lease)",,,,,
Outgoing,Also yes you’ll receive the $200 rebate,,,,,
Incoming,Okay I missed their call. I’m calling back. I’m just getting off work. Thank you,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “The office is going to reach out to you in a secon…”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, sounds good. My pleasure",,,,,
Incoming,Just got off the phone with Tory from Cypress he sent over more videos and information. Thank you my only concern is getting approved through bank account deposit. I told him have deposit large amounts but it’s not consistent. Since I see majority of my money from tips I will save it all and then deposit thousands and thousands at a time. And also my chase account is a new account do to someone taking 13k out of my last account so I was skeptical on reopening one and depositing my money,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7269.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,Which one is this,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, best thing is to figure it out with the office. Usually they’ll take the average of how ever many months they require you to show",,,,,
Outgoing,Those are Lenox grand west,,,,,
Incoming,Bc with tips I make attest $5000 a month. It’s on my check studs but not direct deposit,,,,,
Incoming,Those are cash tips,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Those are Lenox grand west”,,,,,
Incoming,Okay I did see those after prose. I remember,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, so for income you’ll need your gross monthly income to be at least 3x the monthly base rent. Prose might be the only one that is 2.5x so might be the one we’d have to go with 
 
 For reference with income at $5,000 per month at 3x the rent, you’d only be approved for a rent of $1667",,,,,
Incoming,Ok but cypress has 1 for. 1655 do I not qualify and also tips tend to be more but consistently I see about 5000$ every month on average,,,,,
Incoming,What is Lenox and prose asking for and what they need in order to qualify. Do they want checks studs or connection through bank account?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning, you’d qualify for the 1 bedroom if on average you can show $5000 per month
 
 I’ll get that info today",,,,,
Incoming,Ok well please get info on which one wants pay stubs and the other requirements bc I truly feel like applying for cypress and paying for application would be a waste little bit due to them wanting to connect to bank for deposit statements,,,,,
Outgoing,"Prose ktx will accept bank statements. They will calculate based on the average that is deposited each month. 
 
 Only issue is they’re 3x the rent as well so you’d only be approved for a 1 bedroom. Note that all apartments check income based on gross so income before taxes too. I’m trying to get in touch with Alta Cypress to see if they’ll accept your bank statements",,,,,
Outgoing,Lenox grand west we can’t because that price in the $1500’s is after specials and your need to be approved at the base rent amount before specials,,,,,
Incoming,Okay do they just require statements or all of them want me to give them direct bank information to link to,,,,,
Outgoing,Prose said they will take just the statement. I’ve seen other buildings highly recommend linking your bank account but not make it a requirement,,,,,
Incoming,"Ok and I don’t mind doing that I just know that it’s a new account. I have put in about over 25k in it but not frequently like every 2 weeks so I don’t know how frequently they looking for if you get what I’m saying. Like I just put $4,000 before leaving for Houston last week. Rather than paying for these applications for $200 I rather be truthful rather waste my time and money and get denied",,,,,
Outgoing,"No I get you. Most important is to know your income will qualify. Apartments will generally accept bank statements they just highly recommend logging into the bank to avoid fraud. I wasn’t able to get in touch yesterday, I’ll try again today",,,,,
Outgoing,"The 2 bedroom at Alta Cypress for $1655 was leased unfortunately 😔. Prose would be your best option now, unless you want me to check with West End to see what the requirements are for their 1 bedroom?",,,,,
Incoming,Man that’s some bs 😒,,,,,
Outgoing,"To be frank, I see this all the time. These units don’t stay forever and when you’re dealing with an apartment with one unit cheaper than the rest it’s going to go first. I know circumstances are different, you have to make a decision and ask the office about applying and just apply. Otherwise more units are going to get leases and/or prices and specials are just going to change. 
 
 I think we’re back at West End. And we need to see if they’ll accept your bank statements. Because Prose at $5k a month, you won’t be approved for their $1699 two bedroom.",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know your thoughts,,,,,
Incoming,Whatever you feel like is best. I know the holiday season is coming so my checks studs would be a lot more. How much income I need in order to get approved for 2 bedroom. Lowkey I’m trying to stay calm and not get stressed out. I know the 1 bedroom can be to start off but I may need that 2 but I’ll just have to pray on it,,,,,
Incoming,Good morning what’s your thoughts about Lenox reserve? I had like Lenox grand west but I didn’t like the entrance way with the breezeway type of feel then having to take an elevator especially with a toddler. Do you know if Lenox reserve have a straight building entrance like west end? I hope I’m making sense,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, good morning. Lenox Reserve is going to be the breezeway feel. 
 
 I just looked back at Alta Cypress Spring and they have that unit for $1655. I think we should try for that one. Let me see if I can get in touch now to ask a few questions about the income. 
 
 Could you tell me how often you make those deposits into your bank?",,,,,
Incoming,My check is deposit every 2 weeks from my job but that’s only for hourly but when I collect all my cash tips from them maybe every 2-3 weeks. Rather just deposit $350-400 at a time,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, if your bank statement can show at least $5k per month. I think you should apply for Alta Cypress.",,,,,
Outgoing,I just got off the phone and they will accept any verifiable income. So Stubbs or bank statements in your case will be fine,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “I just got off the phone and they will accept any …”,,,,,
Incoming,Hey Ok thank you. So they are offering hold up to 6 weeks or 8? And how much for application plus administration fee,,,,,
Outgoing,"No problem. 6 weeks free. And I believe app is $75 and admin is $150
 
 There are two units at the price now. Manager decided to “put them on sale”. Units #5201 and ##7302.",,,,,
Incoming,Ok what floors are those consider and how many floors is it,,,,,
Outgoing,"5201 is 2nd floor
 7302 is 3rd floor (top floor)",,,,,
Incoming,Do I need to fill out the application then send in documents,,,,,
Incoming,Or I’ll sent documentations separate for administration,,,,,
Outgoing,Each application can be different. They’ll likely have you upload your documents during the application,,,,,
Incoming,Ok thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course. Let me know if you run into anything,,,,,
Incoming,Thank you and since the rent special is $1655 is that what I’ll be paying every month,,,,,
Outgoing,That is the base rent price. That is the base rent price before the 6 week free special. 1 has already been applied for since yesterday. Only unit #5201 is available for $1655 now,,,,,
Incoming,Is this complex not able to hold units until January?,,,,,
Outgoing,I was told 60 days and you’d just need to call an have them manually put in your move date once you submit your application.,,,,,
Incoming,Ok let me try it now,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “Ok let me try it now ”,,,,,
Incoming,Torrey the manager isn’t aware that you called about excepting my check stud,,,,,
Outgoing,Idk the girls name I spoke to but it was Tuesday at 2:53pm if they can check the call log,,,,,
Outgoing,Did she have something different to say about accepting your bank info?,,,,,
Incoming,Who is she,,,,,
Incoming,Questioned “Did she have something different to say about acce…”,,,,,
Outgoing,Torrey. Unless Torrey is a guy,,,,,
Outgoing,I spoke with a girl,,,,,
Incoming,Okay. Yeah Torrey is a guy. We gon keep talking with the girl. I’m on there website,,,,,
Outgoing,Well if Torrey is the manager and the girl gave me some wrong info we need to make sure the info is correct. And ultimately we can’t hesitate anymore. You have to commit if you really want to make this move,,,,,
Incoming,Trust me I don’t want to be hesitant as well. Especially about to pay for application fee. That’s why I’m asking so many questions and get clarity,,,,,
Incoming,I did the application but where do I send check studs,,,,,
Outgoing,Sorry for the late message. That’s great. Check your email for next steps. If they didn’t require it on the application most likely they’ll give instructions on how to upload your income docs or reach out soon to ask for them,,,,,
Incoming,Ok I’m about to do so. Also how do you like grove east. This process finna stress me out and I’m definitely not trying to stress you out🤦🏽‍♀️ I’m already packing my unit up.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay. I like Grove East, not a bad area as far as stuff being around. Lol I bet. 
 
 Just don’t apply to Grove East without letting me know first. I’ll have to send your guest card before you do",,,,,
Incoming,When I say I’m loosing my marbles and trying not to stay calm I mean it,,,,,
Incoming,"Anxiety, nerves and just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing especially moving away from the only place I know is home. You can send my card over. Can you see what all they offer regarding moving in January or the 60 days hold and accepting checks studs",,,,,
Incoming,Sorry and thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yea it has to be such a scary thing. You’ll thank yourself for it!
 
 I’ll send your guest card today. They didn’t pick up but close in an hour so I’ll try again before they close",,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Yea it has to be such a scary thing. You’ll thank …”,,,,,
Incoming,Thank you. It’s one thing to move but out of town is a different type of feeling. Knowing it may be what’s best but then you know you always have doubts on the what if it’s not but I’m trying to look at that,,,,,
Outgoing,No problem. Understandable. Just think the worst thing that could happen is you have a brand new experience for a year and decide you want to move back,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “No problem. Understandable. Just think the worst t…”,,,,,
Incoming,You absolutely right just getting butterflies thinking about it. I’m excited more than nervous. Just the process of finding the right unit to feel like home is throwing me,,,,,
Incoming,"I see grove East have 2 bedroom
 For 1450 I think. Can you look into this",,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “You absolutely right just getting butterflies thin…”,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes I’ll check it out,,,,,
Outgoing,No answer again. I’ll try back,,,,,
Incoming,Someone called me but I missed it bc I called earlier @12pm.,,,,,
Incoming,Ion like that. They hard to get in touch with 🤦🏽‍♀️,,,,,
Incoming,Hey did you get in touch with grove east. Also are there any more complexes I should consider,,,,,
Incoming,Torey the manager said he didn’t see me application bc I didn’t pay but I didn’t see and option for payment,,,,,
Outgoing,Hey I’m not able to get in touch with grove East. I called Saturday and just called again. The price fluctuates ended on the move date you choose but they do have a 2/2 for $1577 available Dec 21. I’ll just need to see what income verifications they accept,,,,,
Outgoing,Did Torey give you the info you need to finish your application?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Alexus, got in touch with Grove East and they require bank statements as well as pay stubs. Pay stubs will have to be most recent 6 weeks and bank statements would need to be most recent 6 months",,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “Hey Alexus, got in touch with Grove East and they …”",,,,,
Incoming,Hey Can you contact alta. Don’t know why they can’t find my application,,,,,
Incoming,And thank you,,,,,
Incoming,I’m afraid if they couldn’t find it the apartment I wanted is gon,,,,,
Outgoing,Did you ever pay for the application? What are they telling you?,,,,,
Incoming,I’m trying to access the portal to do so,,,,,
Outgoing,"If you haven’t already, I think that unit is gone. It’s not showing on the website",,,,,
Incoming,This is beyond me,,,,,
Incoming,😭😭😭,,,,,
Incoming,Jesus,,,,,
Incoming,When they next special 🤦🏽‍♀️🥴,,,,,
Incoming,Ashanti please find me another unit like cypress,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7579.jpeg,,,,
Outgoing,Those are Broadstone Vintage Park. The others I can suggest are Birchway Spring Cypress and Birchway Perry road,,,,,
Incoming,Ashanti why is this so hard,,,,,
Outgoing,Fidelis Cypress Creek has a 2/2 for $1649. It’s down the street from Alta Cypress,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Alexus, you still looking or did you settle on one of the options?",,,,,
Incoming,"Grove east mostly or Fidelis. Can you look over this quote from
 Fidelis to see if it reasonable. Also I need you to explain more of this break
 Down",,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7609.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7646.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,Which one is this,,,,,
Outgoing,I thought we determined the most you could qualify for based on your income was $1665. Fidelis is too expensive based on that number,,,,,
Outgoing,Those are called Everlee. They’re in Tomball. Pretty far,,,,,
Incoming,Oh nooo,,,,,
Incoming,But if I could qualify do that make sense or grove east is probably just suitable and reasonable for me,,,,,
Incoming,Are you able to get a quote for me for move in fee and rent for jan 15 for grove east,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yea, If you qualify it’ll be fine. Income is white & black though. Based on your bank statements you either qualify or you don’t, there’s really no guess work",,,,,
Outgoing,Grove East has a 2 bed 2 bath for $1553 available Jan 12,,,,,
Incoming,Ok and with move in fee would I pay that and rent or is it prorated just trying to get clarity bc this is my second apartment. I’m still learning,,,,,
Outgoing,"There’s no move in fee. There’s a deposit which is $1000 and you’d pay prorated rent so depending on the move in date you choose, you’d pay however many days are left in the month of January",,,,,
Outgoing,Alta cypress spring has a few for $1650. I think you should call them up and see how long they can hold for you and all the details you need. If they can hold for you and accept your bank statements I’d consider applying today,,,,,
Incoming,Ok bc I have all that,,,,,
Incoming,I’ll call,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Ok bc I have all that ”,,,,,

Incoming,With Fidelis it look like if I could qualify the rent would go down in March,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes there’s a Walmart like next door and other stores close by,,,,,
Outgoing,"That was for the other message about grove East… and yes correct, rent would go down in March for the rest of your lease",,,,,
Incoming,No that was fidelis cypress,,,,,

Incoming,They had a great deal but I couldn’t move in due to the surgery but basically do they still have prorated rates,,,,,
Incoming,I look to move by March. I moved out my apartment and now live with mom,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Yes I think your best option would be the B2 floor plan. 2 bed for $1765 + 1 month free,,,,,
Incoming,Okay and that’s not including the fees of trash etc,,,,,
Incoming,The amenities fee,,,,,
Incoming,Which other place would you recommend that’s similar to fidelis,,,,,

Outgoing,Good morning. Yes I do. Self prorated price would be $1770 + 6 weeks free = $1548/mo. I believe the 2 beds in the 1600s are already prorated so I’ll need to double check if we can get an even cheaper price,,,,,

 Best price on 2nd floor is $1785 + 6 weeks free = $1561/month
 
 Best price on 3rd floor is $1670 + 6 weeks free = $1461/month",,,,,
Incoming,"Ok but I want to do cypress so
 Can you collect that",,,,,
Incoming,If I fill out the one for cypress spring I would still be able to do the 1000$ look and lease because you went for me or is in direct contact with the office right? Just trying to make sure I’ll be able to qualify and no mishaps. Also is my $200’rebate guaranteed?,,,,,
Incoming,Or is it more so like “your word is your bond”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes, she said she put in your file that you’ll be getting the 6 weeks free + $1000. It’ll show on your lease contract. And the $200 is from me so that’s guaranteed",,,,,
Incoming,Can you send me a direct link for apartment 3201. I only see apartments available for $1800 and not 1700,,,,,
Incoming,I want to make sure I get both specials and a unit on the 2nd floor not 3rd or 1st,,,,,
Outgoing,For what building?,,,,,

Incoming,What units are available for 2nd floor with both special,,,,,
Outgoing,"For Alta Cypress Springs

Incoming,Okay and for apartment 3201 I’m qualified for the 6 weeks+$1000 and if I get approved the $300 may be waived?,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes correct,,,,,
Incoming,And the $1000 can be credit or applied when I want?,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_9077.PNG,,,,
Incoming,Imma just put 23rd since march 1 not an option. I get 30 days correct,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes you’ll get the credit upfront. And the unit is held for 2 weeks but we can have the office manually change your move date to March 1st,,,,,
Incoming,Got it. Is the living room a decent size. Look kinda small in the video on their page. I don’t know if it’s because the islander is in the middle but have you seen it in person,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Yes you’ll get the credit upfront. And the unit is…”,,,,,
Incoming,You know I have a 3 year old so just asking,,,,,
Outgoing,"I haven’t seen that actual floorplan in person. But, between Alta Cypress Springs and Alta Grandway. For the price and special and amount of square feet you get. These are the best deals for two bedrooms hands down",,,,,
Incoming,How many studs do cypress need so I can download and do they need all checks studs to be 3x $1785 or all the studs combined,,,,,
Outgoing,"I believe it will be last 3 but you’ll just want to follow the directions on the app. Some times they don’t ask for the stubs and they’ll ask via email after the app is submitted. 
 
 Approval is based on Gross monthly income before taxes, that amount needs to be 3x $1785",,,,,
Incoming,Ok I don’t see where to upload and pay,,,,,
Incoming,Or refer,,,,,
Outgoing,"For payment, make sure you get all the way to the end of the application. And they may not have an option to upload, you’ll probably get an email to upload via email. 
 
 And for the referral, look for anything asking you how you found out about the property and select Apartment Locator when prompted. If there’s nothing, they don’t worry, just go ahead and complete the app",,,,,
Incoming,Ok doing it now,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “Ok doing it now ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Ok. I’ll be here if you need,,,,,

Incoming,You think I will love cypress 😭 I’m so anxious,,,,,
Incoming,You seen it in person not me 😭,,,,,
Outgoing,"Of course. Yes I think you’re going to love it. You’ll be new to the city, it’ll be a breath of fresh air. Once you move in you’ll feel the excitement and relief lol 🥳",,,,,
Incoming,Hey I got an email and they want me to go thru something called nova credit to hook up my bank account. I got a new account so that’s why I was asking your about checks studs which I did submit online,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_9083.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,Will this be a problem. I hope not because I wouldnt have applied if so. That’s why I made sure I got all my checks stud that was needed,,,,,
Outgoing,Just give them a call in the morning and let them know your circumstances. With this I’ve seen it’s not a requirement it’s just highly recommended to allow them to connect your account. Stubs should still be fine,,,,,
Incoming,Okay. Tomorrow is Sunday. So Monday?,,,,,
Outgoing,Tomorrow they’re open 1-5pm,,,,,
Incoming,Can you just shoot the person who you were in communication with an email so they can expect my call? Also what is their name,,,,,
Outgoing,I spoke to Denise. Would you rather me speak to them?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes that would be great. I did all that was asked and submitted 3 check studs.hopefully connecting bank isn’t a big deal bc I just did all that for nothing,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll let you know when I get in touch with them. Apartments generally have their own method of approving and it’ll usually be more than one way since people have their own unique situations (like yours)",,,,,
Incoming,Yeah bc I just opened a new account after someone hacked my last account and wired themself $13k so yeah,,,,,
Incoming,My checks were getting deposit in my mother account so I wouldn’t have to wait for paper to be mailed a week later,,,,,
Outgoing,I’m really sorry to hear that smh. How are you providing check stubs? Like physical? Or what kind of platform?,,,,,
Incoming,I had to download them from my portal from my job,,,,,
Incoming,I logged in and gained access,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay,,,,,
Incoming,Good evening have you contacted Denise on my behalf,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good afternoon, yes I spoke with the off-site team. There’s only one person in the leasing office today so I haven’t been able to get ahold of the on-site. But I let the off-site team know the situation and the office will be contacting you with another way for you to verify your income. I was told they will reach out to you either today or tomorrow.",,,,,
Incoming,"Thank you. What will be most likely the other options so I can be prepared. Hopefully this won’t cause home
 Up bc I wouldn’t never have applied",,,,,
Outgoing,"My pleasure. I know the whole process can make you feel anxious, you just have to wait for the options they present. It could be check stubs but they may want them sent a certain way. Just wait for them to reach out and let me know when they do. If they haven’t by the end of tomorrow let me know also",,,,,

Outgoing,I can’t wait for you both either!! That’s amazing,,,,,
Outgoing,I’ll see about it. Most likely something you can ignore,,,,,

Outgoing,Liked “Okay. About to call back cypress called ”,,,,,
Incoming,Did the office receive referral? When will the $200 Zelle?,,,,,
Incoming,I can use that for U-Haul,,,,,
Outgoing,"So, how it works is my company Zelle’s you once the property pays your referral. That’s generally within 60-90 days of move-in so usually a nice surprise! That’s also when I get paid from the referral so we’ll be getting paid at the same time",,,,,
Incoming,Ok maybe you should have clarified that. Also how many weeks I have to move in from move in date of Mar 1. Is it 2 weeks or 30 days,,,,,
Outgoing,If you set your move date of March 1 that’s just when your lease begins so when you’d start paying rent. But you can technically move in any day you want after that date,,,,,

Outgoing,I haven’t spoke to her directly but she was informed by the off-site team of what’s going on,,,,,
Incoming,Okay thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Okay thank you ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Welcome!,,,,,
Incoming,Hey Ashanti can you show me and guide me on how to figure out my prorated price for the apartment so I can keep up with it,,,,,
Incoming,I know you and the management company said this is something I have to do myself.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, yea absolutely. So what is your base rent amount, special you received, and length of your lease?",,,,,
Incoming,$1775 and 12 months,,,,,
Outgoing,And the special on your lease is 6 weeks right?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes and the $1000,,,,,
Incoming,Correct?,,,,,
Incoming,The $1000 does apply to my unit I applied for,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes that’s correct. So you’re going to get a credit for the 6 weeks free and $1000 into your rent payment account over the first couple months of your lease. From your credit, you’d take $305 of that each month and put it towards your rent and pay out of pocket the rest. That would bring base rent down to $1470 per month before monthly fees.",,,,,
Incoming,Thanks you,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course. Did they send you the lease yet?,,,,,
Incoming,I just got an email saying congratulations,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, whenever you receive your lease to sign let me know",,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_9234.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,This was sent. I’m finna get on my computer to see if a lease is attached. Also if I move in march 5 what will I be paying $1470? And also I don’t have to pay the $300 Right ?,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. You will be paying a prorated rent amount for March so you’d pay for March 5-31. And what $300 are you referring to?,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_9235.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,Lease,,,,,
Incoming,And I was referring to the $300 that must got waived when I approved,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, yes looks like the $300 was waived. And you’d need to let them know before you sign that lease that you want to move in on March 5th. Other wise you’ll be paying starting from Feb 23",,,,,
Incoming,What is denis email,,,,,
Incoming,I just email them to edit so the lease reflect March 5,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay perfect. Shouldn’t be a problem, it’s a manager override so expect a response I’d say Monday",,,,,
Incoming,Ok the emails wanted a response within 48 hrs I don’t want them to think I’m not trying respond,,,,,
Outgoing,"It’s okay, they aren’t going to pull your application. It’s normal to have some back and forth between the office before finalizing everything. If we havent heard anything by Monday we’ll call.",,,,,
Incoming,Okay thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Okay thank you ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Alexus, checking on you. Were you able to get your move in date changed to March 5th?",,,,,
Incoming,Hey Denise said she was going to email me the new lease reflecting that date. I know she was busy and tired Monday so I thought she would have sent it yesterday but I haven’t received anything.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll reach out today to have her send it",,,,,

Outgoing,Pleasure is mine!,,,,,
Incoming,Hey Denise sent over the revised lease but it’s $100 more than we initial added up. I did call and speak with Melissa. She said she will forward my message and tell her to call me back,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_9294.jpeg,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, thanks for the heads up. Many times the price will change as you push the date further out but I wasn’t informed that would happen in our case. Please keep me in the loop for when Denise responds!",,,,,
Incoming,Yeah that’s what I thought but I do understand but I know if there wouldn’t have been a price difference then I would have made sure to move in to make sure it was the $1591. But as you see I’m ready to sign and send over just need clarity,,,,,
Incoming,Did she not apply something? I emailed the office as well expressing my concerns,,,,,
Outgoing,Understood. Yea it shouldn’t be a problem. Any case you can always revert the date back to lowest price. Just wait for their response,,,,,
Incoming,Ok just trying to make sure we all in the same page especially since all this is new to me doing the prorated math,,,,,
Incoming,But I did sent proof if renter insurance,,,,,
Outgoing,Yes no problem. We’ll go after the cheapest rate,,,,,
Incoming,"Yes thank you but I’m
 On it. I signed the lease if those numbers do stand corrected but if they need to be changed then that would be lovely as well ☺️",,,,,
Outgoing,Don’t sign the lease with those numbers on them. You want the lease you sign to reflect the amount you agree to pay,,,,,
Incoming,Absolutely!,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Don’t sign the lease with those numbers on them. Y…”,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Absolutely! ”,,,,,
Incoming,Hey I just called the office Denise called off but will be there tomorrow. Melissa looked over my lease. Instead of 6 weeks they gave me 4 weeks. I asked Melissa can she explained why she says Denise would have to,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay let’s let Denise clear it up. We’ve been working with Denise not Melissa so before we get worried about anything let’s let Denise address our concerns,,,,,
Incoming,Absolutely. I was just calling so they don’t think I’m annoying the emails,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. It would be really bad faith to reduce your social now so we’ll see what Denise has to say,,,,,
Incoming,Reduce my social ?,,,,,
Outgoing,Special *,,,,,
Outgoing,Sorry,,,,,
Incoming,Yeah that would suck nbs like once you told me I applied the same week,,,,,
Outgoing,Yea I know. We’ll get to the bottom of it,,,,,

Outgoing,Give me a min to respond. Lease looks good though,,,,,
Incoming,Okay thank you. I’ll be waiting then I’ll sign and send back,,,,,
Outgoing,"You should be paying $1470 every month. 
 
 First month you pay $660 to them and put $810 aside
 
 2nd month (April) you’re NOT required to pay rent. STILL put $1470 aside
 
 *You’ve now put $2280 aside ($810 + $1470)
 
 3rd month you pay $892.50 to them. Put $577.50 aside ($1470 - $892.50)
 
 *You’ve now put $2857.50 aside ($2280 + $577.50)
 
 Months 4-12 you will be billed $1785. Pay $1470 out of pocket. Pay $315 out of the $2857.50 you put aside. That will last you for your whole lease",,,,,
Incoming,Omg and I would have to keep track of all this,,,,,
Outgoing,"To keep your monthly rent to $1470 that’s how you’ll want to do it. That’s how we finesse to be in a brand new 2 bedroom for $1470. New 2 bed apartments aren’t under $1500, so that’s how you’ll use the special to knock down price. Save the message if you need.",,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_9359.heic,,,,
Incoming,You said April would be free but what does this mean. I just have so many questions to be in good standing and be responsible that’s all,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “To keep your monthly rent to $1470 that’s how you’…”,,,,,
Incoming,Okay I understand I just want to make sure I know what I’m paying and the company does too rather thinking I didn’t pay just to pay or I’m short,,,,,
Outgoing,"Those are upfront concession so the credit amount you’ll receive each month. 
 
 At move in you’ll receive $1000.
 In April you’ll receive $1,785 which is the entire cost of base rent. And May you’ll receive $892.50 which is half the cost of base rent. That will be your total 6 weeks free + $1000",,,,,
Outgoing,I understand. Just follow my message from about and you’ll be good. Keep in mind of course those are all base rent amounts before fees,,,,,
Incoming,What if I didn’t want to do the $1000 upfront? Or would this be easier. You know I’m from Chicago and I’m just like why none of this clicking right now. Then April you said I do lay but I’m not required,,,,,
Incoming,After May which mean in June I’ll be paying 1470 or no. Remember I wanted all this to be distributed through 12 months and it seem like everything is getting applied all at once,,,,,
Outgoing,"They don’t prorate for you so you have to do it yourself. It’s fine to have the credits all upfront. Actually, as long as the apartment allows you to pay over your owed amount you can just start paying $1470 from the first month and be fine since your credits will already be in your account. You can literally reach out every month when it’s time to pay rent if you want and I’ll let you know what you should be paying",,,,,

Incoming,Okay bc I call no answer,,,,,
Incoming,Do I just call or how do I got about it,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes that’s something you can call for or email. Most apartments will have a grace period to pay rent for a couple days with no penalty so try again tomorrow. 
 
 For energy you can call or just set up online by going to the website. I’d say try TXU energy or Reliant. The prices are generally comparable.",,,,,

 Houston Heights 
 Galleria 
 Montrose
 Uptown 
 Memorial City 
 
 I’m very new to Houston though so I’m open to hearing about places in other areas.",,,,,

Incoming,"Ok perfect thank you! 
 And I don’t want to go too much higher for a 1/1. I would really prefer for it to be lower than $2100 tbh lol but I could do $2100 if I think it’s worth it.",,,,,
Outgoing,For sure! Not a problem. What days of the week work best for you for apt tours?,,,,,
Incoming,"Weekends are going to work best for me since I get off at 4:20 and I work in Katy.

Outgoing,For sure! Yea lol well it’ll depend now. It seems like you fell in love with the idea of having a den or 2nd room. Are you still open to a 1 bedroom?,,,,,

Remy and Rowan are the newest apartments in the area besides a few that I wouldn’t recommend over them (Allora near creek, Avasa Spring Branch, Westover west branch, define living Brittmore). They’re made cheaply in comparison to Rowan and Remy. 
 
 The only one that may be an option and not get you all the way back in the city is The Hayworth. It’s a Highrise about 5 miles from Remy closer to central Houston. The Hayworth has a unit “The Pine” floorplan that’s 934 sqft for $2123 available Aug 23

 I hate that for me but it’s ok. I’ll stick with Remy on the Trail. 
 
 Thank you so much for helping me find an apartment! I was struggling before lol so I really appreciate it",,,,,
Outgoing,"I’m sorry 😞 Houston really emphasizes their apt building in the city or outskirts. Not so much in between. 
 
 My only concern is that the living space for the B3 at Remy will be smaller than you like when you see it in person so definitely weigh the pros and cons between that one and the A8 (2nd unit we saw) that you liked at Rowan. 
 
 And I’m happy to help! Lol I’m glad we were able to narrow it down",,,,,
Outgoing,"Last thing, very Important is when you apply there will be a place on the app that asks “how did you hear about us?” Or “who referred you?” Or something like it. Please choose Locator/Realtor and add my info (Ashanti with the Nav Agency/Apt Amigo)
 
 I’ll be here if you need anything so reach out with any questions or concerns, anything I can do to help!",,,,,

Incoming,Heey so I was able to look at that B3 unit at Remy on the Trails the other day and the living room wasn’t too bad so I’m going with it. I’m just tired at this point lol,,,,,
Outgoing,Heyy. Okay. I hate that I have the feeling that you’re settling for less than you want 🙁. You happy with the B3?,,,,,
Incoming,"lol no It's fine. Ideally I would love to stay downtown bc that's probably more of my speed. Like yesterday when I went to Remy on the Trails, 2 old men hit on me and that's just not what I wanted for myself lmaoo 😭 but I do like the actual apartment so I’m good with it.",,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Lol I’m sorry. You might not be able to escape that regardless of the area lol. But as long as you’re good with it I’m good with it.,,,,,
Outgoing,Hey just wanted to check on you. Still all good?,,,,,
Incoming,"Heey, yeah everything’s good! I moved in and everything. 
 Wait did it not come through on your end? Do I need to go talk to that man??",,,,,

 Thanks for being so descriptive on your form. For budget, I got $1300. Is that number strict or slightly flexible?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey! No problem and thank you! Looking forward to working with you guys.
 
 I’d like to get as close to 1300 as possible (or even less) but also, from what I’ve seen, most of the options that I like have been starting at 1300 and so I am willing to flex about 100 or so",,,,,

 I recommend Coop Heights also. Great option, great location and 1 bedrooms at $1135 www.coopheights.com

You’ll still need to pay a move deposit and most times you just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out.",,,,,

 As my lease ends in September, I’ve been re-evaluating my goals and I think it’s time for a change. I’m looking to move somewhere more budget-friendly—ideally around $1,000/month. I’m open to being a bit farther out from the center if it means getting a nice, comfortable place in a safe area.
 
 If you’re available, I’d love to work with you again to help me find the perfect spot for this next chapter. Let me know what the next steps are!",,,,,

Incoming,"Yes, I am okay with those areas! I don’t really have a particular area in mind, but I do want somewhere that is safe (especially for walking my dogs am & pm)! 
 
 I have been enjoying exploring inside of this area, so ideally somewhere in here would be great, but my biggest priorities with this move for this next year are safety, and cost! Just really wanting a good year to get ahead!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll send you a few options today. We’ll start getting you scheduled for tours once you’ve picked a few favorites! I’ll send deals under $1100, is that ok?",,,,,
Incoming,"Sounds perfect! 
 
 Other things I’d need or prefer (same from last time):
 
 Allows dogs
 Parking 
 In unit washer/dryer
 AC
 Dishwasher
 
 only new things I would like are
 - a bath tub
 - a fitness center/gym
 - maybe a business center (somewhere to get work done)",,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it! I just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 *Keep in mind a lot of availability won’t show for late September until the end of this month
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,

 Friday, July 11 
 12 PM – domain on the parkway 
 1 PM – Avenue M 
 2 PM – 55 fifty NW Crossing
 
 Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Outgoing,We weren’t able to confirm Ltd Med Center. They don’t pick up phones and have no guided tour scheduling ability on their website. They have a self guided tour option that you can do and you would need to sign up yourself for the 10:30am slot. They verify your identify so we couldn’t sign up for you,,,,,
Outgoing,https://selftournow.com/property/f241671f-023b-4662-b03b-711d7a94d5ae/units,,,,,

Outgoing,Niceee!!! Okay perfect,,,,,
Incoming,"Just finished the last tour
 
 Definitely 
 
 LTD Med Center 
 Or
 55 Fifty NW Crossing",,,,,
Outgoing,Okay perfect. What in particular has you torn between the two?,,,,,
Incoming,"I am kinda leaning more towards LTD Med Center as my top pick. I loved them both!
 
 I feel like 55 Fifty is slightly more conveniently located, but I loved the amenities and the access to them at LTD (55 Fifty had time restraints to all of them except for the gym) 
 
 And I just had a really good feeling about LTD when I was touring it so I think that’s gonna be my #1 pick!",,,,,
Incoming,"I think the last determining factor will be pricing. I know at 55 Fifty, the lady giving me the tour said I was eligible for essential housing so I would like to see if I am also eligible at LTD Med Center",,,,,
Incoming,and see what those prices come out to,,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it! That’s perfect, did you receive all the quotes and information you need on pricing from both of them?",,,,,
Incoming,I just received the information for Ltd!,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_6775.PNG,,,,
Incoming,"I’m assuming because I wouldn’t be moving until September, I would get on the waitlist?",,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “I just received the information for Ltd! ”,,,,,

Outgoing,Of course!! I’ll be here if you need anything,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Koby, just wanted to check in with you. Did LTD let you know if they had something for September?",,,,,
Incoming,Hey! Yea. Right now the latest move in date they have is September 3,,,,,
Incoming,So I’m wondering if I should wait a eeek or 2 and then re-inquire about it?,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Yes that’s probably the best option. When is the soonest you’d want to move?,,,,,
Incoming,"Honestly, thinking about it, I may aim for the second week of September (around the 12th) because it’ll give me 2 weeks to get fully moved out of here and into the new place!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I’d shoot to apply as soon as that date becomes available before anyone else applies for that unit, so next Friday",,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I’d shoot to apply as soon as that date becomes available before anyone else applies for that unit, so next Friday”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Koby, checking in with you. It would be a good time to check for availability at LTD if you haven’t already. I saw they had some availability for September but figured talking with a leasing agent for any units specifics you want would be ideal!",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Koby, can I help you get in touch with the office or were you able to speak with them yesterday?",,,,,
Incoming,"Yes if you can! Thank you!! 
 
 I called them twice yesterday and Tuesday and wasn’t able to get anyone on the phone. I also emailed them a few times and haven’t received a response",,,,,
Outgoing,They have a 1 bedroom available September 4th for $1145 that you can push move date to late September. Is the A1.80 the unit they mentioned you could be approved for?,,,,,
Outgoing,Good afternoon! Just following up on my last message. Do you remember what tier 60 or 80 that LTD said you were qualified for?,,,,,
Incoming,"Hey! Sorry for the delay!
 
 This was the email she sent me after my tour when I originally asked about availability and essential housing, and send her my household income",,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7084.jpg,,,,
Incoming,"I’m not sure which unit this is, but I emailed her back a few times and didn’t get a response.

Outgoing,"Morning Koby, just making sure all is going smooth so far with your application. Has LDT been communicating with you?",,,,,
Outgoing,Making sure all is going well with LTD?,,,,,
Incoming,"Hey, Sorry I’m getting back to this so late!! It’s been a hectic start to the week but I have a few updates.
 
 So they denied my application at LTD.
 
 However, recently I have been interested in getting into property management and decided to shoot the team here at CoOp Heights and email, just reaching out for some advice
 
 they told me to stop by the leasing office and we chatted for 3 hours, they ended up dropping my rent increase, and might be hiring me here so I think I will be staying here now for another year 🙏🏾
 
 I just have to get some updated pay stubs over to them so I will keep you posted, but I appreciate you and all of your assistance thus far!",,,,,

Outgoing,How did you like The Star?,,,,,
Incoming,Star was okay but not as nice as the other places,,,,,
Outgoing,"Right... Never expect a discount at Camden Downtown lol. Maybe $1000 off or something but 1 month free, etc you can forget about it. I haven’t seen them do that in the 5 years I’ve been doing this lol",,,,,

Outgoing,"Gotcha, so for a December move we’re a little early to search. Nothing will show for December right now. We’ll want to search around October for a December move. That’s when 60 day notices will be in from current renters and we’ll have the most options to choose from. Prices and availability can change on a daily basis and new buildings will have opened by then as well. We can start and complete our search, have you applied and approved in a matter of a week or two also. How about I reach out periodically and when move date is closer we’ll start our search. You’ll thank me for it I promise! Sound okay?",,,,,

Outgoing,"Okay, 60 day notices for the end of November will be in by the end of September so we’ll search then. I’ll take a quick look this weekend to see if much is showing early and let you know!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Precious, I just emailed your list. They all should work for November. 
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you",,,,,
Incoming,I’ll stick to my Katy/fulshear area 😭. It’s too many cars on bricks. And I think I would just rather prefer a drive in garage unit.,,,,,
Outgoing,Nooo 😩 I want you to get what you want. Are you sure? Whats most important about the area if you were to consider being closer to the city?,,,,,
Incoming,Unless I’ll just wait long for more openings. I’m in no rush. But didn’t like the reviews on the apartments,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, we can wait a week to see what shows up. If there’s one you can look further into it’s Modera Garden Oaks. Brand new and great prices",,,,,
Outgoing,I’ll follow up next week with options in Katy/Fulshear and any others that show up closer and we can start scheduling next weekend to get you squared away before you leave on the 24th,,,,,
Incoming,The modern garden oaks was great but the surrounding area not so much. Maybe that’s just the aspect of living within the city im not used to seeing with the bus stops and all.,,,,,

Outgoing,I wanted to make sure you’re able to get in before leaving for travel,,,,,
Incoming,Good afternoon. Not able to talk on phone right now,,,,,
Incoming,The Katy areas you send I’m familiar with but not interested in those listings. I think it’s best I stick closer to town. Maybe 1 bedroom for the price I’m desiring.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, no problem. When you say closer to town are there certain areas you’re looking to be in or close to?",,,,,
Incoming,Montrose,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll send some options in a bit. Are you still trying to tour and decide before you leave Tuesday?",,,,,
Incoming,Yes I would like to tour before leaving,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, and what was the date you’ll return that you need to have your apartment by?",,,,,
Incoming,If you have unit available for October 12 it would be nice,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay,,,,,
Outgoing,"Just emailed your list. Not only Montrose but all central within i610. A few I wanted to highlight for different reasons…
 
 Alexan Junction Heights - Convenient Heights location walking distance to Target and other shops/stores
 
 Modera Waugh - Great Montrose location. Across the street from Whole Foods
 
 Aspire Post Oak - One of the more luxury buildings in Houston. Across the street from Whole Foods. Great price for 1 bedroom in this building
 
 Forth at Navigation - One of the better floor plans at the price point

Outgoing,Okay,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good evening Precious, so sorry for the late message but wanted to make sure you got the schedule via text also that was sent to your email. Here’s your schedule for tomorrow…
 
 Saturday, September 21
 2pm - East Bend
 3pm - Forth at Navigation
 4pm - Elev8
 
 Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Precious, how did tours go over the weekend? Are you leaning toward any in particular?",,,,,
Outgoing,,Audio Message.caf,,,,
Incoming,Thanks for following up. At work right now. All 3 are great options I liked. I’m currently just monitoring the rates to see how they fall. I have another I’m considering Caroline memorial although it’s not too close to the city but it still works .,,,,,
Outgoing,"Of course. Sorry to bother while you’re at work. Okay great, a few things to consider with an October move-in around the corner. Playing a waiting game with apartments is similar to airlines and they can change specials and prices at any point so I don’t recommend especially with summer already being over. If you apply and later see a cheaper unit you want you can just have your app changed to that unit if you still haven’t signed your lease yet
 
 Forth at Nav increased prices a week or so ago for all A4 units besides 1 which is still in the $1900’s available 11/7. Great option with elevated 15ft ceiling that I anticipate will be leased before the price comes down. 
 
 Elev8 prices have stayed pretty consistent since opening so you’ll be good on price until they reach a certain % occupancy. The only drawback of waiting is they are running a special up to 6 weeks free now that will go away once they hit the number of move-ins they are looking to hit from this special
 
 East Bend feel free to catch any price changes. They’re a little more volatile. 
 
 Caroline at Memorial is a beautiful property but they dedicate a % of units to essential housing which are significantly cheaper units. I suggest avoiding essential housing building if you can because they usually see a steep decline in luxury after opening naturally because of the affordability of their units as low as the $1100’s (you won’t qualify for these units. It’s a city program)",,,,,
Outgoing,…just my opinions to help with your consideration,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Of course. Sorry to bother while you’re at work. O…”,,,,,
Incoming,Thanks for the insight. Especially on the last one. I had my hesitations on that particular aspect as well.,,,,,
Incoming,Okay I’ll try and make a decision sooner than later in that case then.,,,,,
Outgoing,"My pleasure. Yes, you were right on point",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, sounds good. When you do start your application please be sure to lookout for the Locator referral section on the app asking how you found out about the property. It can be easy to miss but really important for me to be listed as your referral",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know a way I can help!,,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “Okay, sounds good. When you do start your applicat…”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Precious, how is the decision making going?",,,,,
Incoming,"Good afternoon. 
 I don’t think I’ll be returning to Texas anytime soon. I’m extending my job contract in Nebraska and would prefer to just keep my state of residency here. It’s a lot different from what I’m used to of course. The apartments themselves that I wanted are great but not so much the area. Hopefully I’ll have better luck when I’m moving back.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning Precious, okay no worries. I wish you luck in Nebraska. When you do decide to make your way back to Texas, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take good care.",,,,,

 I see you’re looking for walkability. Are there any areas or neighborhoods in particular you’re considering?",,,,,
Incoming,"I currently stay at one80 midtown 
 I like Midtown, but the area I’m in is not that good 
 I like river Oaks, sometimes some parts of the heights, but some of the areas aren’t as developed and some parts of downtown, but homelessness is really bad in that area
 
 I have a dog so I walk her often so I want an area where when I walk her it’s relatively safe. I’m looking to move in November. That is when my lease is up so I’m on a time crunch.",,,,,

I just went off of what I liked in the apartment if it looked kinda open in area, based upon the list you gave",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay. On top of the options you chose I’d say look further into these…
 
 Grey House - River oaks connected to River oaks district. I think you’d like area and the unit is 851 sqft
 
 Avenue Grove - it’s a building people love or hate. Big park area right outside building. And big windows in all units. 
 
 Alexan memorial- location on memorial drive is great for pet owners and close to memorial park. Unit is available 11/7 though so will need to ask current apt for a few days. Usually isn’t a problem

 Rice Village/west university village
 Baybrook/Webster
 Greenway
 Near memorial park
 
 I’m looking for something between 600-800sqft, no studios, preferably nothing under RPM management. My current rent is about $1700 with included fees but I would prefer to pay less but I’m willing to pay up to 1699 for base rent if the utilities are modern and worth the price. I also would prefer new builds and to be on the top floor. I don’t want anything with brown cabinets or anything like that, very modern. And it needs to be near shopping centers, a target and H‑E‑B (preferably). I know it’s a lot and hopefully it’s doable but I’ve had really bad luck with my last two apartments especially my current one. Also, I’m really big on pests so I would like to stay somewhere where they don’t have any infestations of any critters of any kind.",,,,,
Outgoing,Got it! What days of the week work best for you for touring?,,,,,

Outgoing,"Oh got it. 1 bedrooms have a month free too. Best price would be for their A4. $1949 + 1 month free = $1786. 
 
 The special price would be for the entire lease. You’d have to self prorate, meaning instead of taking the special and using it all at once and not paying rent for a month. You spread it across the whole lease which will bring the monthly amount down",,,,,

Outgoing,They want your move in date for residency from. Monthly payment can be base rent,,,,,
Incoming,I’ve been at my current complex for 3 years…should I just put the move in date for this past year?,,,,,
Incoming,"I just put August 2, 2022 but I honestly don’t remember the exact date. I’ve been in this unit for 2 years so it’s not far off because I actually did move into it in August but I don’t remember the exact day",,,,,

Incoming,Okay so I was looking at the units…and I’m wondering if unit 5404 will be better? Is it too late to change? I don’t think the A3 was available to look at when I viewed. This particular unit is available on the November 20th and it’s a little cheaper than the one I chose…this one is 702sq. ft. for $1550 and the one I chose is 703 for $1600. What do you think?,,,,,
Outgoing,Let me check,,,,,
Outgoing,"Unit 5404 is available 12/5. $1550
 Unit 2303 is available 11/20. $1550
 
 Same price but you’ll need to extend your lease 3 more days to get 5404 which is top floor. Lenox wouldn’t have an issue switching your application to 5404, you’d just want to call and tell them that’s what you want. I think it may be worth it.",,,,,
Incoming,I’m going to call now but I just wish I was able to view it.,,,,,
Incoming,Okay so they said they said that I can view on October 15th and then I can view the A3 unit and that if I choose to switch by then that will be fine since I don’t move out until December.,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay sounds good. I can’t really see much difference from the floor plan photos on line. Looks like placement of the balcony and maybe a slight difference in size of bedroom but identical otherwise,,,,,
Incoming,Yea the bedroom is much smaller and the living room is bigger in the A3,,,,,
Outgoing,Got it,,,,,
Incoming,Would you happen to have any good recommendations for movers?,,,,,
Outgoing,They come recommended by my team,,,,,

Incoming,"Hey! I’m assuming so, they called me as soon as I sent in my application and then said all I needed to do was upload my last 4 pay stubs. I did that last week but they haven’t contacted me since I uploaded them",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll see if they can update you. You’ll usually get a formal approval",,,,,
Incoming,I don’t know if they are waiting to see if I want to change units but I’ve already decided to stick with the one I have. When I called them they did mention that they’ve already saved the unit for me but that was it,,,,,

Incoming,"Just got done touring the apartments. Quick question, I noticed that they’re under the same property management company but the one I chose has more expensive charges than the one I toured today. Is that normal?",,,,,
Outgoing,Everything go well? Yes that’s normal. Property charges can differ from building to building regardless of management,,,,,
Incoming,"Got it. The tour went well, I can tell the highlight of this property is that it's close to the marina which I do love. But I felt that the upkeep of the property wasn't up to par. There was trash, left outside of units and the one unit that she showed me that I liked, she said that no one had lived there before, but it was clear that someone did live there because there looked like it was a TV mounted and they took it down, covered it up and painted over the walls. I'm going to make a pros and cons list of both properties but more than likely. I'm going to end up going with my first choice.",,,,,
Incoming,I'm definitely glad I got to see the property and see firsthand what it has to offer. But I'm starting to catch on that when a leasing agent tries too hard to sell some thing that it's usually not the best.,,,,,
Outgoing,Got it. I’m glad you got a chance to see it too. It’s always good to be clear on all your options. And overselling is definitely not the best sign. It sounds like your first choice will be the one to go with but let me know either way what you end up deciding. And as always if I can do anything at all just let me know!,,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Adjani! No they haven’t but I’m all good, thanks for your concern. My company invoices them and apartments generally pay within 60-90 days of you moving in. Once they pay is when you’ll get your $200 rebate too via Zelle 🙂",,,,,

Outgoing,That’s amazing!! So happy to hear that! Never hesitate to reach out for an update. My support doesn’t stop at your lease - I’m here whenever you need!,,,,,
Incoming,"Morning Ashanti! I hope you’ve been well. I just wanted to give you the heads up that you may want to tell your company to take Lenox Bayside off y’all’s list and not do business with them anymore. Early Saturday morning my car was vandalized. All my tires and rims stolen and left on cinderblocks. I was the only car they touched so someone definitely was watching me long enough to know my daily routine and knew what time I would not be out my home. And the week before a car was stolen. They never notified me of anything or let the community know that a car was stolen because they said they didn’t want to put anyone’s personal business out. The office has shown zero urgency about me being traumatized from this and made sure that they enjoyed their weekend, instead of coming in to deal with this. And the assistant manager sent me an email saying that “this happens anywhere” and I shouldn’t expect the courtesy officer to be patrolling 24/7 when he has a job at HPD. They don’t deserve anyone’s hard earned money",,,,,
Outgoing,Good morning Adjani! I’m sooo sorry to hear that. I really hate to hear any stories like this and really sorry you’re having to go through this! Thank you so much for letting me know. I will definitely let my company know. Are you okay?,,,,,
Incoming,"Not really. I wasn’t able to go to church or spend time with my mom and grandmother for Mother’s Day. I was stuck here and I still am. But most importantly I’m traumatized and scared because I have reason to believe they had help from someone here. I was targeted for a reason and a random visitor wouldn’t be able to know my schedule enough to feel comfortable and prepared to do this to me. I’m not safe here, but hopefully I can at least get my car towed today to a dealership or mechanic because I’m already missing work today",,,,,
Outgoing,I’m really sorry Adjani. Are you thinking about exploring your options for getting out of your lease early?,,,,,
Incoming,It’s crossed my mind but I’m not able to afford to move right now. But I’m definitely going to leave when my lease is up for sure so you can already count on me needing you when that time comes,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll definitely be here to help the time comes. In the mean time please update me on any other issues and let me know anything I can do to help",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Asia! it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment. Just a couple details so I know exactly what you’re looking for!
 
 Do you have a lease ending soon or is your move date open and flexible?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hi, I’m looking for something in the city area or humble. 2/3 bed room. 
 I currently don’t have a lease I’m moving back to TX from Boston. I’d be open to an early Oct move in date if we can pull it off.",,,,,
Outgoing,Got it. Will you be visiting to tour apartments in person before the final move or are you planning to only tour virtually?,,,,,
Incoming,I planned to be there to view the places however the timing doesn’t align. So virtually may be the best option. Also I wanted to add possible dog friendly. My daughter keeps asking for one. Just to add.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, no problem. I got budget at $2600. Is that flexible or strict max?",,,,,
Incoming,Flexible with the price; however I prefer 2bed over 3 but I’m open.,,,,,
Outgoing,No problem. We’ll have many 2 bed options. Is there a max price cut off I should stick to?,,,,,
Incoming,I’d say for 2 bed try to stick to that price range.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it. Any other must have features you want to make sure I look for as I search? Sqft requirements, specific amenities, unit features, etc?",,,,,
Incoming,It would be a nice to have a gym and pool but not a must. Also sqft is not a factor just something decent.,,,,,
Outgoing,Gotcha! I’ll send some options in the next hour and we can start setting up virtual tours from there,,,,,
Outgoing,"Just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all virtual tour scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Any options you see above $2600 are running specials and will be below after the special. With the exception on Forth at Navigation which is a client favorite - $2845 + 1 month free = $2630/mo
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Incoming,Okay great! Thanks I’ll take a look now.,,,,,
Outgoing,My pleasure! Sounds perfect,,,,,
Incoming,"Hi Ashanti 
 I was able to check out the listing you sent. I’m really interested in Eleve unit C2 or C3. 
 
 However I’m curious of the specials run at the Travis unit B4 
 And Drewery place B1.2 both 2bd 2bath.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hi Asia, okay sounds great. I’ll get all the specials info for you over the weekend and start getting virtual tours together",,,,,
Incoming,"Sounds great. Have a great weekend. 
 
 Thanks",,,,,
Outgoing,"Thanks, same to you. 
 
 Happy to help!",,,,,
Incoming,"Hi ashanti, just wanted to check in. I had difficulty with my phone Friday so I wanted to make sure I didn’t miss anything.",,,,,

Outgoing,Oh I see. No that post was from last year,,,,,
Outgoing,Which day this week will work for tours? I’ll be the one to FaceTime with you. I can do pretty much any day besides Wednesday,,,,,
Incoming,Okay. I’ll be able to view tomorrow around 2. If that’s doable?,,,,,
Outgoing,You’re Eastern time right?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes,,,,,
Outgoing,"Tomorrow I can tour all morning and the last tour I could go on would be at 12pm (1pm eastern). Could that work to see all three or does a block of time Thursday work better?
 
 We can also split them and tour one tomorrow at 12pm (1pm Eastern) and tour the other two on Thursday?",,,,,
Incoming,Okay the second option sounds good. Perfect!,,,,,
Outgoing,Sounds good! I’ll schedule for The Travis and let you know when it’s confirmed,,,,,

 Thanks",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “Hey Ashanti, looks good looking forward to the vid…”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also the price on the B8 at The Travis dropped over night to $2469 which is an outstanding price. Very possible someone applies to this unit before tomorrow if seen. If you loved it I’d suggest paying the application fee to take it off the market, with no obligation to sign the lease. 
 
 I also recommend checking the Drewery Place and Elevè websites for the options you’d be considering to compare the floor plans and unit at The Travis which is 1522 sqft. Sorry to apply any pressure, but I see units taken daily. Just my thoughts & something to consider.",,,,,

Outgoing,Please let me know once you’ve submitted an application and anything I can do to help!,,,,,
Incoming,Sounds good!,,,,,
Incoming,Another question - any of these places Airbnb friendly. Most my family lives on the east coast and I have a sick brother. So traveling often is a huge possibility. I just want to know if would have a problem airbnb my space out if I was out of town longer than a week.,,,,,
Outgoing,Unfortunately not for Airbnb. Most of Houston’s apartments aren’t Airbnb friendly so many who do have Airbnb’s are without an agreement with management.,,,,,
Incoming,"Oh okay. I was unaware. 
 Good to know. Thanks",,,,,
Outgoing,"Liked “Oh okay. I was unaware. 
 Good to know. Thanks ”",,,,,
Outgoing,Of course,,,,,

Outgoing,Yes you can put Ashley’s name. Those names are for leasing agents. The spot for Apartment Locator is for me,,,,,

Outgoing,Morning Asia ☀️okay great thanks for letting me know. I’ll be here to help throughout the application process so let me know anything I can do,,,,,
Incoming,"Sounds good, thank you.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “Sounds good, thank you. ”",,,,,
Incoming,"Good morning, I filled out my application yesterday. When it came to the section where I I add my ID and paystubs I put all that in the drop down file box. But it also asked for my 3 year daughter ID and paystubs. It wouldn’t let me continue the application without putting something in for her so I put mine in. I believe that why the system flagged it. I thought it was looked at by a person who could see why the error happened. Is there anyway Ashely could give me a call directly? I’d like to do it over or maybe she can take a look at it.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning, okay yes give them a call directly. Just ask for Ashley. Let me know if you have trouble reaching the office. Sounds like something we should be able to get past no problem",,,,,
Incoming,Called and left a voicemail.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, she’s pretty good with following up. If you don’t here anything by mid afternoon let me know and I’ll try to get in touch",,,,,

Outgoing,Of course!,,,,,
Incoming,"Hi, 
 haven’t heard anything back yet. Is there a direct contact?",,,,,
Outgoing,Are you using 281-318-1562?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes,,,,,
Outgoing,"I just spoke to them. They said the application was denied due to rental history, not the pay stubs. Do you have a broken lease on your rental history?",,,,,
Incoming,"Yes, when my father died it was years ago. I could’ve given an extra deposit.",,,,,
Incoming,Any way I can have a print out of my report?,,,,,
Incoming,"I was able to get them on the phone. They are emailing be a summary report. However, I wanted to ask you if there’s a place you know of that will allow me to put more money down instead of an immediate denial.",,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. How long ago was the broken lease? Do you still have a balance at that property?,,,,,
Incoming,"It was 2021, I believe it $1500 left; the building was sold to and it was impossible to contact anyone regarding the balance owed.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, let me ask my team",,,,,
Incoming,Okay,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Asia, we didn’t come up with any options that’ll work with the property debt, I’m sorry. There are locators who work specifically with past broken leases that might be able to help better. Just search for “second chance apartment locator”. Sorry I couldn’t help",,,,,
Incoming,No worries thanks anyway.,,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Xosa! it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment. Just a couple details so I know exactly what you’re looking for!
 
 What areas or neighborhoods are you considering?",,,,,
Outgoing,,Audio Message.caf,,,,
Incoming,"Hi there , apologies for the late reply. I’m not super familiar with the areas. I know of the heights , Katy , willing to live a little further out from Houston but prefer to be around 20 mins from the city, if outside of the city. 
 
 We are looking for an affordable 2 bed , spacious closets / room sizes big enough to fit a king. Double sinks in the bathroom if possible , side by side / French door full size fridge, wood floor , washer & dryer in unit, lots of natural light , spacious kitchen / island in the middle preferably, balcony",,,,,
Outgoing,"No worries. Okay I got it, I your move date open and flexible or do you have a specific date you need to be moved in by?",,,,,
Incoming,"I’m moving from ATL, looking to move by late December / January",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, will you be visiting to tour apartments in person or will everything be virtual until you apply?",,,,,
Incoming,Visiting either by the end of next month / early November,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay! For a December/January move we’re a little early to search. Nothing will show for then right now. You’ll be right on time when you visit since we have a 60 day notice system so when you visit most of the 60 day notices will be in from current renters moving out so we’ll have the most deals to choose from. Prices and availability can change on a daily basis and new buildings will have opened by then as well. We can start and complete our search, have you applied and approved in a matter of a week or two also. How about you reach out when you schedule your dates to visit and before you come I’ll send all of your best options so you have a chance to see deals with the actual current prices and availability. You’ll thank me for it I promise! Sound okay?",,,,,
Incoming,Yeah sounds great. Thank you!,,,,,
Outgoing,Perfect. Of course!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Xosa, hope all is well. Wanted to make sure all is the same since we last spoke. Are you still planning to visit this month or November and move from ATL Dec/Jan?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hello, yes that’s correct. As of right now i plan to be in town 10/29-11/2",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay perfect. And I’ll go off of this criteria unless anything has changed. 
 
 What’s max budget you want to stay under?",,,,,
Incoming,"Yes pretty much the same , I’m open to most areas up to 40 mins outside of the city. Would prefer to be closer to the city though. 
 
 & Under 1800 for budget",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, sounds good. I’ll send you some options over the wknd and we can start to narrow down which you want to see and have tours all set up for when you visit!",,,,,
Incoming,"Ok great , thank you",,,,,
Outgoing,Happy to help,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good afternoon Xosa! I just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling for when you’re in town👍🏽
 
 Prices you see on the list are without applicable specials which can significantly bring monthly rent down
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll keep those in mind and we’ll finalize your options closer to your trip from 10/29-11/2",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice).

Outgoing,"Hey Xosa, I just emailed you some options in Humble and Cypress. Let me know all that you want to add to tours for your visit 👍🏼
 
 Many are running specials so even prices slightly above $1800 will be under for monthly rent. Here’s an example of Elevè on your list who’s running a 1 month free special…
 
 $1847 + 1 month free = $1693/monthly with prorated special",,,,,

 I’ll pass on the Broadstone properties.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, no problem. 
 
 Any feedback on features, locations, etc that you like most about the tours we’re keeping so we can set up more that you’ll like?",,,,,
Incoming,"It’s mostly features , the traditional speckled marble counters are not my fave. 
 
 I think for most that I’m keeping they are within 20-30 mins away from the city which is cool with me. The heights or galleria area are also great if it’s affordable.",,,,,
Incoming,"I also have been meaning to mention , I’m also open to a 1 bed with a den area",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning, okay I got it. I’ll take another look today. Ultimately from what it sounds like, I think you’re going to love Modera garden Oaks. Location, price, unit, plus special brings you well under budget.

Outgoing,Please let me know in the mean time if you plan to tour any other apartments and allow me to schedule them for you as your locator 👍🏼,,,,,

 Do you have a lease ending or is your move open and flexible?",,,,,
Incoming,Pretty open and flexible but preferably the week before Christmas or the week of New Years,,,,,

Outgoing,"Good morning Kidan, I just emailed your list!
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 One of my favorite layouts for the price is the A4 at Forth at Navigation. Here’s a link to check it out:",,,,,

 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Incoming,"Hi Ashanti, a couple questions.
 
 1. The prices that are reflected does that include any amenity fees or valet trash or anything else they may have? Just so I know as I’m picking 
 
 2. What do you mean by a free move or $200 cash rebate? 
 
 3. What happens if I’ve toured one of these before? I use to work with a different locator so I know how it works for yall. Just want to make sure you still get credit if I retour with you.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hi Kidan, prices you see will be base rent prices before fees. They also don’t reflect any specials or concessions (Ex. 1 month free) which I will let you know of before any tours. 
 
 For working with us, my company gives you a $200 cash rebate sent via Zelle or a $200 moving credit. I recommend the rebate, it’s cash sent straight to Zelle and paid out the same time I’m paid 
 
 If you toured before just let me know which one and I’ll send a guest card to them before you tour again. And on your application you’ll need to indicate me as your locator",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know if you have any more questions!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Kidan, following up quickly on your search. Will you be touring this weekend?",,,,,
Incoming,"No, I had to go out of town this weekend. I’ll look at them again this week and get back to you on which ones I’d like to tour.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “No, I had to go out of town this weekend. I’ll loo…”",,,,,
Outgoing,Okay sounds good. Safe traveling,,,,,
Incoming,Thank you!,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course!,,,,,
Incoming,"Hi Ashanti, we’d like to tour the Oliver and 4th at navigation on Saturday. Preferably back to back with the first starting at 1pm! Let me know if that’s possible please",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Kidan, for sure. I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Incoming,Thank you! Just got the text from the Oliver!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Perfect! For Forth they only have one slot available unfortunately, and it’s Sunday at 4pm. Does that work?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Actually, you also have the option of doing a self guided tour, without an agent on Saturday at Forth if that works better?
 
 I usually would like to be on those for sure to guide you but I’ll be out of town this weekend",,,,,
Incoming,Self guided is fine as long as I can tour the actual unit.,,,,,
Outgoing,You’ll be able to tour the A4 unit which is the same floor plan but a furnished model. Not the actual unit. Tenants are still in the actual unit.,,,,,
Outgoing,You’ll need to schedule the self-guided tour yourself because they verify your phone number and ID with you. Use this link and click on “Schedule a self guided tour”,,,,,
Outgoing,https://liveatforth.securecafe.com/onlineleasing/fourth-at-navigation/scheduletour?_gl=1*6ywwxx*_gcl_au*Njk0OTI0NTc1LjE3MzE2MTU1OTU.*_ga*ODcxMjQyMzU1LjE3MDYzMjc5NzM.*_ga_MF30TQS4LT*MTczMTYxNTU5NC4zMy4wLjE3MzE2MTU1OTQuNjAuMC4w,,,,,
Incoming,I’m actually interested in the A6 or A7 but sounds good. I’ll get with them and see what I can tour!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Got you, sounds good! From what I can see, there are only A6’s and lowest base rent price will be in the $2300’s if you move in the week before Xmas. Just a heads up!",,,,,
Incoming,"Yeah I saw that on their website.
 They currently have 2 available,
 I’m semi flexible on move in so I’ll just see on Saturday.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay perfect. Keep in mind that for a self guided tour. The tour is guided by an app and the route is pre determined to have you see that A4 model. To see one of those A6’s an agent will need to see you to the unit, and it’s possible they’re so swamped. You could try your luck Saturday. My suggestion is we book that Sunday 4pm slot just in case, up to you",,,,,
Incoming,"I have a Friendsgiving on Sunday so wouldn’t be able to do that, I’m just going to try Saturday, it’s okay if they can’t as of rn I’m leaning more towards the Oliver anyways but who knows. 
 
 Also, is it possible for you to send me a few more but with studies. I’ve realized a study is basically a must for me now.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it, sounds good
 
 Yea sure, I’ll take a look tonight and send what I find before morning 👍🏼",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good evening, sorry for the late message but wanted you to wake up with some info. I added a couple more to your list. 
 
 -Alta Sunset Heights which is brand new just opened 
 
 - Modera Garden Oaks built just last year
 
 Both of these you’ll be looking at two bedrooms within price range after specials",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Kidan, do you want to add tours for either of these?",,,,,
Incoming,"No, not right now. I’ll just tour these first.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “No, not right now. I’ll just tour these first. ”",,,,,
Outgoing,Sounds good,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Kidan, how did your tours go over the wknd? Were either of them a fit?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Questioned “Hey Kidan, how did your tours go over the wknd? We…”",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey sorry I typed out the message and never sent it, It went well, I didn’t love the Oliver like I thought I would and I don’t like the location of 4th on navigation. I’ve realized I’m more picky than I thought. I found a few on my own I’ll prob tour this weekend but I’ll still put you down as my locator.",,,,,
Outgoing,"No worries. Okay, thanks for that. I’ll search again tonight given the new info. Which did you find on your own that you’re going to check out?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good evening Kidan, I added a few more to your list. Here they are below with a few highlights. Let me know if you’d like to schedule any for this weekend
 
 Artistry Design district - Brand new just opening. 2 beds start at $1985 + 1 month free
 
 Lenox Oaks - Very nice. Built 2023. Great location Greenway/Upper Kirby. 2 bedrooms start at $1995 + 1 month free
 
 Citadel apartments - These pleasantly surprise many clients. Built 2020. Quiet community. 2 bedroom is spacious and a great layout with huge balcony at $2025",,,,,
Incoming,"Good morning! 
 
 Thanks for sending those over, I have a few on my list as well. These are the ones I like so far but I need to narrow it down to like 5. 
 
 Lenox oaks
 Alexan river oaks
 Art house 
 Foundry on 19th 
 Citadel 
 Modera garden oaks 
 1825 downtown
 Camden downtown 
 Drewery Place",,,,,
Outgoing,"Morning! My pleasure, thanks for the list. 
 
 How do you want to narrow down so I can help? At least a few of these won’t have a study or second bedroom within price range.",,,,,
Incoming,"Nothing you can help with narrowing down, I just need to look at floor plans and take out what I don’t love. I know a few are outside of what I asked but some were nice enough to make some exceptions. So if you can find some that are very nice complex I’m willing to go without the den just needs to be 900sq + so I can fit a desk. 
 
 Can you book a tour at citadel and Modera garden oaks for Saturday morning one at 11am & one at 12pm",,,,,
Outgoing,"Ok, got you. Yes, I’ll schedule Citadel and Modera. 
 
 1825 downtown would be a waste of time in my opinion. Not well kept at all",,,,,
Incoming,"Okay, I’m taking off 1825 & Camden downtown",,,,,
Incoming,And foundry on 19th their reviews are horrible,,,,,
Outgoing,"Liked “Okay, I’m taking off 1825 & Camden downtown ”",,,,,
Outgoing,Emphasized “And foundry on 19th their reviews are horrible ”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, consider Alta Sunset Heights too.",,,,,
Outgoing,Citadel is fully booked on Saturday and Modera has availability between 2:15-3pm. Let me know how you want to proceed,,,,,
Incoming,Are either open on Sunday?,,,,,
Outgoing,Modera is but fully booked. Citadel is closed,,,,,
Incoming,"Damn, is citadel available tomorrow? I could do a 4:30pm",,,,,
Outgoing,Latest they have tm is 3pm 😕,,,,,
Incoming,"Okay, I might just have to do those 2 after thanksgiving. What about Lenox oaks on Saturday?",,,,,
Incoming,And artistry design tomorrow?,,,,,
Incoming,I don’t mind this one but I don’t like the location of it. I’d be willing to tour if the other ones don’t work out,,,,,
Outgoing,"Artistry only has a 4pm on Saturday. They have a 4:30,4:45, and 5pm today though if you could make it
 
 We can do Lenox. I’ll schedule for Saturday @ 11am",,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “I don’t mind this one but I don’t like the locatio…”,,,,,
Incoming,"I can’t do today, also what do you know about the Travis?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay. The Travis is okay in my opinion. It’s a Highrise with concierge, etc but floorplan matters because they have so many. Some of which I’m not a fan. 
 
 It’s where a lot of people go if they really want to be in a Highrise but in my opinion they’re just ok",,,,,
Incoming,"Okay that’s fair, I really just love the floor to ceiling windows.
 I’ve heard mixed reviews about the Travis but most people say stay away so I won’t even bother touring.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “Okay that’s fair, I really just love the floor to …”",,,,,
Outgoing,I agree,,,,,
Incoming,"Okay so this is my plan for this weekend, I’m free Sunday if artistry is open if not, everything I don’t do this weekend will have to be the weekend after thanksgiving",,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_3779.PNG,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay perfect, is everything scheduled that you need to be scheduled? 
 
 Everything else you want to tour we should probably start scheduling now for after Thanksgiving. I’ve see a lot of apartments booked out pretty far",,,,,
Incoming,"Yes, everything for this weekend is booked, you can book the last 3 for Saturday Dec 7th cause I’m out of town from Nov 26th till Dec 4th.",,,,,
Incoming,Don’t worry about Taylor heights that’s a back up if non works out,,,,,
Outgoing,"Reacted 👍🏽 to “Yes, everything for this weekend is booked, you ca…”",,,,,
Outgoing,Reacted 👍🏽 to “Don’t worry about Taylor heights that’s a back up …”,,,,,
Outgoing,Will do,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Kidan, I hope tours went well today! When you get some time I’d love to know which you liked best so I’m on point about your preferences",,,,,
Incoming,"I’m about 99% sure I’ll be signing at Drewery place. I just need to see how long they can hold the unit I want. Also, I filled out the locator form before I did the tour there.",,,,,
Outgoing,Okay nice. You still looking to move the week before Christmas or after New years? And thanks a lot for that,,,,,
Incoming,Looking to move in after new years now cause the unit isn’t even available till Christmas eve,,,,,

Best way to handle it is to go to your leasing office and let them know the situation and ask how you can be let out out of your lease (there will be fees but the LAST thing you want is a broken lease that is not a mutual agreement on your rental history) and we can find you a new apartment in the price range you need.,,,,,
Incoming,thanks for the advice and i will do that Thursday,,,,,
Outgoing,"Of course, I’ll be here if you have any more questions",,,,,
Incoming,ok thank you but i will be moving again around September if they let me,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, just keep me in the loop and we’ll find you another apartment for September",,,,,
Incoming,ok thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,My pleasure,,,,,
Incoming,"can you send me some apartments thats $1,350 and under anywhere in houston?",,,,,
Outgoing,Yes of course. You may qualify for reduced rent apartments depending on your new income. What is your new monthly gross?,,,,,
Incoming,"$4,000",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I have some options for you. You don’t necessarily have to settle for any area though. What area(s) would be most ideal?",,,,,
Incoming,i work downtown so something thats 20 minutes or less away,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay got you, i’ll send you some options today",,,,,
Incoming,thank you 🙏🏾,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Destiny, sorry for the late message. I just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 *My favorite is probably Co/Op farmers market at $1299
 
 *Also you’ll receive your $200 rebate for working with me again of course 
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up once you get the okay from your apartment to move",,,,,
Incoming,yes I drove past farmer market Co/op it was really nice,,,,,
Incoming,i favorited 4 of them. i will be speaking with the leasing to the leasing office tomorrow,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “yes I drove past farmer market Co/op it was really nice ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “i favorited 4 of them. i will be speaking with the leasing to the leasing office tomorrow”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay perfect, let me know what happens tomorrow",,,,,
Incoming,I called them ill be putting my early termination in on July 1st,,,,,
Incoming,So my move in date for the mew apartment would be August 29,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay sounds good. Do you have the paperwork to show your new income? For Co/Op Farmers market you’ll need to show the your income is under $56,640.",,,,,
Incoming,i have a recent paystub,,,,,
Incoming,,77057300733__3EF239AD-9AA6-474A-B3BF-8F5A02E1FD7E.HEIC,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, we may want to accumulate a couple more paystubs before touring and applying so that your income is calculated based on only the new income. I’d say at the beginning of July will be best",,,,,
Incoming,ok thats cool,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “ok thats cool”,,,,,
Incoming,hey what other options do I have because my checks are going to be bigger due to me having to pay out the lease at the current apartment,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, what will your income be?",,,,,
Outgoing,You’d have the same options in that case since it’s pretty much the same budget. Right now I still think your best option will be Co/op Farmers Market,,,,,
Incoming,"they said without the income based it would be 1,400",,,,,
Outgoing,"Your effective rent at Alta is $1360 per month when considering your special. If your income went back up it seems like you’d be spending a lot more just to move and save not so much, no?",,,,,
Incoming,"yeah, that makes sense",,,,,
Outgoing,"So do you want to stick it out or try to figure out your options? Truthfully, under $1300 and not income based, will not be the most desirable apartments. Especially if you’re looking for a short commute to Downtown",,,,,
Incoming,i want to try to figure out my options. are there some in the closer to the spring branch area,,,,,
Outgoing,We can take a look at 55fifty NW crossing at $1335 + 1 month free = $1232/mo. Timbergrove Station has units at $1317. Broadstone Amarra has units at $1344. A few other options would be closer to base rent of $1400,,,,,
Incoming,yes I think we should take a look at 55fifty NW Crossing,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, is Saturday best?",,,,,

Incoming,"Good morning it went well, out of all of the tours I really like the prose Deerbrook property. Unfortunately they don’t have a patio but I’m really weighing if that a dealbreaker. 
 It did make me realize I do prefer the outer parts of Houston like Humble much more.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Nicee. Ahh yes the balconies, that’s partly why they’re able to keep prices so low even for renewals. They have a few more Prose properties scattered around the city too. Are you open to other outskirt areas like Katy, Cypress, Spring, Richmond, etc? Or do you want to stay close to Humble specifically?",,,,,
Incoming,"That’s understandable, but I’m open to spring and cypress as well",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, sounds good. I just updated your recommendations and added 5 more properties in the Spring/Cypress areas. Let me know which you’d like to check out and I’ll have them scheduled for when is most convenient 👍🏽",,,,,

Right now you can either try luck with walking in without a confirmed tour or wait until we can get in touch 🫤",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey no worries I’ll wait one the standard, go to evolve at 12, and I’ll most likely go back to prose at deerbrook as it was definitely at the top of my list as well. 
 Thank you so much 😊",,,,,

 Many I sent are running specials so will be under $1600 after specials even if they show to be slightly over. I’d say my favorite is Alta Sunset Heights. They’re brand new and you’ll be paying in the $1300’s after the 1-2 month free special.

I’m scared I may be putting too much on my plate…. As much as I want to move, it may be unrealistic for the timeframe that I have. 
 
 I work from home. My job consists of being on the phone for majority of the day and the noise at my complex is what has me anxious to move but I think I’d be more comfortable planning for later in the year. Im currently at San Estrella",,,,,
Incoming,"Beautifulllll place but I can hear everything. From showering, coughing, even plugging things into the walls we share 😭",,,,,
Outgoing,Understood! Has San Estrella sent your renewal offer yet? It’s possible you save money by moving too. What budget do you want to stay under?,,,,,

Incoming,04/30. I’m looking for a 1bed + study but I’d be open to a 2Bed. No first floor units lol,,,,,

Outgoing,Loved “I agree. Sounds like a plan! ”,,,,,

Outgoing,"Happy to help! Last questions, budget still $2300 and under for 1 bed with study or 2 bedroom?",,,,,
Incoming,Yes,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Yes ”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 All will be 1 bed + study or 2 bedrooms. Some base rent amounts are slightly over $2300 but will be under when you self prorate the special. Since we’re more than 60 days from your move I added options that are available from now to your move. One I think you should see asap is Bowen River Oaks. They have one 2 bedroom available in April within budget. Might now want to wait for next wknd to see that one 
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 I’m able to do that when you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you!",,,,,

Outgoing,"Lol the free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate because the move never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay a move deposit and you just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out.",,,,,

Incoming,An extension would be like $40-$50 extra,,,,,
Incoming,A lil bittersweet about that 🤣,,,,,
Outgoing,Wait! I’m confused lol. What kind of extension?,,,,,
Incoming,"My bad 😂 to extend my current lease, it would be roughly $50. It would be 6mo",,,,,
Incoming,Where I was projecting it to be like $400-$500,,,,,
Incoming,"My last apartment charged me $125 and it was very ghetto lol…. I just assumed it would be a lot higher here. 
 
 I hate that I put you to work like that but at least now I know where I want to be for my next place",,,,,
Incoming,I sent you a voice memo earlier saying I was gonna swing by the office and see how much my renewal/extension would be … I guess it didn’t send lmao,,,,,
Outgoing,Ohhh I see! Okay so you’re going to stick it out with San Estrella for 6 more months after your lease?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes 🥺 I have 2 summer trips that I’m saving for + my birthday is in September so id prefer to wait to move,,,,,
Outgoing,"Understood! That’s okay, you just want to be prepared that you’d be moving in about 9 months or so, so Briarly may be off the table as they lease and raise their prices.",,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “Understood! That’s okay, you just want to be prepa…”",,,,,
Incoming,Aw man …they were perfect! Do you think it’ll be a significant difference in price?,,,,,
Outgoing,It really depends. Price will go up and they’ll take the special away when they reach a certain number of renters. My concern for you would be that it doesn’t take them long to hit their numbers because we haven’t seen new apartments in the galleria for a while so people are definitely going to be going there,,,,,
Incoming,Lord have mercy 😭 well it’ll definitely be something for me to look forward to. They made me so proud today I’ll have to keep my eye on them,,,,,
Outgoing,"I know lol maybe not though, you never know. Yea at least we have some great options. Make sure when you start looking again that you don’t do it without me!",,,,,

Outgoing,Hey TK! It’s Ashanti with AptAmigo. I hope all is well. How has everything been with San Estrella since extending?,,,,,
Incoming,Hey Ashanti! Soooo I actually ended up moving to Caroline at Memorial. It was a very last minute decision. I literally decided to leave on the last day of my lease and had to pack and find someone to move my things that next morning 😭 there was a lot going on at the moment so I apologize for the lack of communication but I hope all is going well with you!!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Sheesh, last minute like that must’ve been hectic! How has your experience been so far at Caroline?",,,,,
Incoming,"Very! I like it here, it’s everything I thought it would be but I’m honestly hoping this will be my last time leasing an apartment lol",,,,,
Incoming,Longing for something more private/secure,,,,,

Incoming,"Hey Ashanti! Quick question….
 Is it normal for my apartment complex to want me to verify asset information? Like savings/checkings, investments, life insurance accounts, etc?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey TK! I’ve only seen that for people applying to an essential housing unit. Other than that, never. In what context are they asking for it?",,,,,
Incoming,"Oh okay, gotcha. They just wanted me to fill out a form…. I was just a bit skeptical I’ve never been asked to do this before but if it’s connected to essential housing, then that makes sense",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Whitney! it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your apt form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment. 
 
 What areas or neighborhoods are you considering?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hi Ashanti, thank you so much for reaching out. I’m not too familiar with the HTX area since I just moved here January 2024. Currently I’m out in Katy (Lenox Grand West) but would love to move maybe 10 minutes outside of Katy. Maybe the Memorial city area but I’m not grid locked to a particular area as long as it’s not in the loop",,,,,
Outgoing,Absolutely. Okay got it. I got your budget at $1500 for a 1 bedroom. Is that flexible at all or a strict number?,,,,,
Incoming,It’s strict unless a utility is included,,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it. When does your current lease end? 
 
 And getting a bit deeper on area. Is there a work address you’d like to be close to or do you work from home?",,,,,
Incoming,"My current lease ends 1st week in Feb. I work remotely so I’m 100% flexible on the area as long as it is safe, new, stand up shower, pet friendly. 
 
 My overarching goal is to shave 10 off my 30/35 minutes commute when I travel to networking events or happy hour",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay got it, thanks for the info. Best time to start looking will be the first week of December, when all 60 day notices are in from current renters and you’ll have the most options to choose from. 
 
 What days of the week is most convenient for you to tour apartments?",,,,,
Incoming,That’ll be great! I want to get as much of a head start as possible. Mon-Thursday works and Saturday/Sundays are even better,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay perfect! Let’s let Thanksgiving pass and next week I’ll send you a list with your best options for us to start touring next weekend, that sound okay?",,,,,

Outgoing,"I just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

Outgoing,"Absolutely! Okay, take a look at your list first. To stay within budget I put a number of brand new properties on their located in the Heights. 
 
 Alta Sunset Heights and Artistry Design District are two and they just opened, running up to 8 weeks free. Great time to get in at these discounted rates. 
 
 Best option Downtown within price range will be Prose Hardy Yards",,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “Absolutely! Okay, take a look at your list first. …”",,,,,
Incoming,"Will do, thank you so much ☺️",,,,,
Outgoing,Pleasure is mine! 😌,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Pleasure is mine! 😌”,,,,,
Incoming,"Hi there, thanks again for sending over the list. After reviewing specials and reviews, I’ve narrowed the first list down to brownstone Amarra/Amelia, and possibly Prose Hardy Yards. 
 
 one item that I forgot to mention was 1bd units with stand up shower instead of garden tub. I’m flex with the garden tub if the rent is under 1450. 
 
 Alta was nice but don’t allow self proration so the floor plan that I’m most interested in is out of my price range.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it, thanks for the feedback. I’ll get those three scheduled. Is Sat/Sun best or do you want to schedule for this week?
 
 Noted on the tub. Have you already seen Alta?",,,,,
Incoming,"I can view apartments between 11 AM and 2 PM on December 4. I have not viewed any apartments yet but placed calls to them to inquire about tub, top floor units /prices & self proration",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay. I’ll schedule Broadstone Amarra/Amelia and Prose Hardy yards. 
 *Note that neither Broadstone or Prose have balconies
 
 For Alta, after you pay your prorated amount for move in, you won’t be billed for two months. You can still self prorate but it will look something like this…
 
 Example: Unit 590 (top floor) $1735
 Prorated amount is $1445 per month for 12 months. 
 For your two free months you put $1445 aside and when you start paying rent in month three you have $2890 ($1445 x 2) to pull from. You continue to pay $1445 per month and pull $290 per month from the “pot” you put away the first 2 months. 
 *Note you would still need to be approved at the market rate of $1735 so gross monthly income would need to be $5205 or more.",,,,,
Outgoing,Sorry for the info dump. Let me know if I’m still good to schedule Broadstone and Prose and if you’d like me to add Alta or not,,,,,
Incoming,"No worries, I really appreciate you breaking it down to me. With the monthly package I’ll be back to exceeding the $1500 a month. I wish that I was disciplined enough to self prorate from my own bank account but I know my disadvantages and would prefer apts that allow proration within their system.",,,,,
Incoming,Quick update: I just spoke with Alta again and the lady I just got off the phone with says that they do allow self proration. So I will be credited and can use money towards my monthly cost. Thank you for encouraging me to look deeper into this again. Let’s definitely keep this on the list.,,,,,

Outgoing,"Okay that’s great. We’ll definitely double check if you decide to go with them because we got two different answers in the same day. I’ll schedule all four for this Wednesday. Will 11am,12pm, 1pm, & 2pm work?",,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Okay that’s great. We’ll definitely double check i…”,,,,,
Incoming,"Totally agree! Yep, those times work great! Then Saturday I can tour apts in midtown, downtown, medical center for anytime Saturday preferably morning. 
 
 Preferences for these areas: 
 -under 1500 
 - built in desk/area to work from home
 -safe
 -non smoking
 - external units (not a huge fan of hotel style apts) 
 -top floor
 -walk in shower 
 
 Nice to have:
 -built in workstation 
 - secured car parking, no multi car garages 
 
 Other: I am also 100% open to renting a house or townhome that has an attached 1 car garage.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay great! I’ll get them scheduled. For other tours, I suggest touring Thursday if possible. Altas special is a look & lease meaning 1 month automatically and 2 months if you apply within 48 hours of touring. 
 
 Noted on preferences. I can send options in midtown/downtown/med center for you to choose and we set up tours Thursday. I wouldn’t want you to miss out on that 2nd month free if you decide to go with Alta.

 I have asthma so if there’s anyone on the hallway smoking in their unit, it is very likely I would have an asthma attack .",,,,,
Incoming,"Quick update: I just spoke w/Prose & was informed I wouldn’t qualify for the 8 week special since my move in date is more than 30 days. Also, they don’t have any top floor units available at this time so we removed the tour. She told me that I can just sign a lease with a whole different unit and if a top floor unit becomes available, they can move me, but there was no guarantee. So of course I decline because I didn’t wanna be stuck in in a unit that I don’t want.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Do you mean walking out of your unit you’re outside? Prose is like that. It’s hard to come by those in the inner city. Apartments like that are built more on the outskirts unfortunately. 
 
 And understood on Prose. I’ll keep an eye out and if any come up on the top floor within price range I’ll let you know!",,,,,

Incoming,"Good morning, do you think I could find anything within the shaded area? I know that I frequently IAH the most and currently have a 40 minute ride there maybe this area could cut the commute down?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Whitney, I’ve been checking these last two days for anything new to pop up, and no luck. The only ones I’d feel comfortable sending you are some that we already considered (Broadstone’s, Westover at West branch, Avasa, spring branch, Allora bear creak). 
 
 The farther we go the more remote you’ll be and I know you wanted to avoid that. 
 
 The one I can recommend right now is The Rosslyn Garden Oaks. The unit is 774 sqft going for $1625 + 8 weeks free = $1408. Only issue is it’s not top floor 🫤
 
 That area north of the loop up to IAH there’s virtually no apartments to choose from and on spring branch and west we considered the best within budget. 
 
 We can try Rosslyn if you’d like to tour and Re-tour Alta to get the best idea of it and everything around. I know it’s not walkable but the center of the Heights is only 5 mins away
 
 I’m sorry 😕 trying to really think of all your options that will still keep us in budget",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey Ashanti, sorry for the delay in my messaging yesterday was a very stressful day at work. I’m going to drive by Alta today to tour the surrounding areas again & will keep you posted by eod",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Whitney, no worries. I’m sorry, I hope the problems didn’t linger. Okay sounds good, let me know",,,,,
Incoming,"Good morning, unfortunately it lingered but prayerfully will be wrapped up today. I was able to swing by Alta yesterday and everyplace I need is within 10-15 minutes",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “Good morning, unfortunately it lingered but prayer…”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning, okay 🙏🏼. That’s great, do you feel a little better about the decision?",,,,,
Incoming,"Yep, I’m feeling much better about the area",,,,,
Outgoing,"That’s perfect, I’m glad to hear it 🙂",,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “That’s perfect, I’m glad to hear it 🙂”",,,,,
Incoming,Thank you for helping me to be level headed,,,,,
Outgoing,"I’m happy I could help. Now you can relax, already knowing where you’ll be moving",,,,,
Incoming,Exactly! I’ll keep you posted once I sign the lease. They haven’t sent it over yet,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Exactly! I’ll keep you posted once I sign the leas…”,,,,,
Outgoing,Sounds perfect!,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Sounds perfect!”,,,,,
Incoming,"Hey hey, the lease has been signed with a move in date Feb 5th",,,,,
Outgoing,That’s great! Congratulations!! And again thank you so much for trusting and working with me. I’ll still be here if there anything I can help with so never hesitate to reach out!,,,,,
Outgoing,Also here’s info on your $200 rebate: apartments generally pay us within 60-90 days of your move-in date and you’ll receive it when they pay us. Your rebate will be sent via Zelle using the phone number I have for you and you’ll get a text also when it’s sent. Usually a nice surprise! Feel free to ask any questions there too 😌,,,,,
Incoming,Thank you so much for holding my hand during this process! I’m really excited about my move & will definitely recommend you to anyone I know that’s planning to move ☺️,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Thank you so much for holding my hand during this …”,,,,,
Outgoing,So happy I was able to help! And that’s great! I’m excited for you. Thank you for that! That’s the biggest compliment I can receive is a referral. You’ll get $50 for any referral you send that leases with me also 🙂,,,,,

Outgoing,"Loved “You are so welcome, very much well deserved 🥂”",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey Ashanti, happy new year! I wanted to reach out to see if I could opt for the free move instead of the $200 rebate?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Whitney, Happy new year to you too! The free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate because the move never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay what isn’t covered by the 2 hours and most times you just don’t get the full $200 value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out.",,,,,
Incoming,"Ohhhhh gotcha, I’ll keep with the $200 rebate then. Thanks for the honestly on that",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “Ohhhhh gotcha, I’ll keep with the $200 rebate then. Thanks for the honestly on that”",,,,,

Outgoing,"Morning Hector, lol that’s what I’m here for",,,,,
Incoming,"I have my first review, am gonna be a total honest with you, it seems like a really good options. 
 
 But I think, that the options that you sent to me are small in size (600-700 sqft) 
 
 I’m looking an apt with >800 sqft to 1000 sqft",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, that’s good info. I’ll take another look today.",,,,,

Outgoing,"Yes they do. It’s the A5 floorplan, actually 918 sqft",,,,,
Incoming,"Ok ok, could be our 1st pick, for the tour 👍🏻",,,,,
Outgoing,I went in and updated the recommendations. Many of the properties are running specials (Ex. 1 month free) so price will be even less than you see,,,,,
Incoming,"Ok ok, niceee",,,,,
Incoming,"Here is where it gonna show the recommendations, right?",,,,,

Outgoing,Click below where it says recommendations #2 & #3,,,,,
Incoming,Ohhhh oh sorry,,,,,
Incoming,I will see the #2 & #3 then,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “I will see the #2 & #3 then ”,,,,,
Incoming,Have a question Ashanti,,,,,
Incoming,"This special that have some of the apts, how it works?",,,,,
Incoming,"It’s literally a discount month by month? 
 
 Ex. If I have a 12 mo leasing, paying 1500 usd/month, and they offer a free month of rent in that 12 months",,,,,
Outgoing,"Many times you will get the special within the first couple months, meaning for example if you got one month free, you wouldn’t have to pay rent, for example on the second month. 
 
 Many people will “self prorate” the special meaning rather than pay nothing, split the cost evenly and pay that amount each month even on the month(s) that you receive the special
 
 Example: $1200 + 1 month free = $1100 per month (on a 12 month lease since you’re essentially paying 11 months of rent)",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know if that makes sense,,,,,
Incoming,"Yes, makes sense.
 
 Prorate on each month it will be better, I Think",,,,,

Incoming,Hello Ashanti,,,,,
Incoming,Sorry for not texted u before,,,,,
Incoming,Has been a long n tired trip,,,,,
Outgoing,No worries man. How was everything? Did you get to narrow down your options and make a choice?,,,,,
Incoming,Kinda,,,,,
Incoming,We can saw several options,,,,,
Incoming,even others beside from those that you schedule for us,,,,,
Incoming,"We think artistry design and Citadel, are gonna be at the very top of our list",,,,,
Incoming,Definitely,,,,,
Incoming,What can u tell me about those 2 properties???,,,,,
Outgoing,"Artistry Design District is brand new. You’d be one of the first residents and the first to live in your unit which is great. 
 
 Citadel I like. Smaller community and full disclosure, I actually live here myself and have been really happy with my experience. I’m very low maintenance so don’t need or ask for much from management and I love my unit",,,,,
Incoming,Niceee,,,,,
Incoming,"I think ADD it’s a better option for us, than Citadel (and still a goooood option)",,,,,
Incoming,"But we liked the brand new situation of ADD, the amenities, the apt as it is",,,,,
Outgoing,Yes I think you guys will love Artistry. The location is great also. Nice to i610 so very easy to commute,,,,,
Outgoing,When did you plan on submitting your app?,,,,,
Incoming,I think will be in the next week,,,,,
Incoming,"How is the zone/area at ADD and Citadel?
 
 in all the aspects",,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “I think will be in the next week ”,,,,,
Outgoing,They’re in a similar area. Close to the Heights which is a highly sought after area. Short commute to pretty much anywhere inside the i610 loop and you can also commute out quickly west toward memorial or north. Both great options. Not many specifics for Aritstry since it’s so new but I like the area of Citadel and Artistry is only a few miles away,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Hector, wanted to make sure you’re still all set with Artistry. Do you have any questions or concerns before applying?",,,,,
Incoming,Hello Ashanti,,,,,
Incoming,What I need for applying to ADD?,,,,,
Incoming,Sorry for the delay,,,,,
Outgoing,No worries. Everything will be done online right on the website. Do you know the unit you’d like to apply to?,,,,,
Incoming,Morning Ashanti,,,,,
Outgoing,Good morning,,,,,
Incoming,"Yes, we do",,,,,
Incoming,"A few moments ago, I sent a email to Stephanie (leasing manager)",,,,,
Incoming,Showing the interest for the model of floorplan A4,,,,,
Incoming,It will be my first time applying to an apt,,,,,
Incoming,I don’t how to do it as well 😂,,,,,
Outgoing,Can you show me the A4 you’re talking about? I don’t think Artistry Design District has a A4 floorplan,,,,,
Outgoing,And that’s okay! I’ll walk you through it,,,,,
Outgoing,"Very Important: when you begin the application there’s a question “How did you hear about us?”
 
 Choose “Locator”. That’s the only way the apartment will credit me for us working together",,,,,
Outgoing,,IMG_2261.PNG,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know what questions you have when getting started,,,,,

 This bc in the application it didn’t appear as a “section” to put your name on it, as a locator",,,,,
Outgoing,"Man I’m really sorry to hear that. And wishing you have a fast recovery 🙏🏼. 
 
 I was really happy to hear you got approved. So happy for you guys!

Incoming,"This policy does not require a contract or early cancellation fees; it is paid monthly. If the start date of the policy is 02/28/2025, the initial payment will be $13.25. Subsequently, an automatic charge of $13.25 will be made every 27th of the month. The next payment will be on 03/27/2025.",,,,,

 Is your move date open and flexible or do you have a lease ending?",,,,,
Incoming,Hello! My lease ends March 9,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay! Are you coming from out of state or already local in Houston?,,,,,
Incoming,I’m in Houston,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, so for a March move we’re definitely early to search. Nothing will show for March right now. We’ll want to search around January for a March move. That’s when 60 day notices will be in from current renters and we’ll have the most options to choose from. Prices and availability can change on a daily basis and new buildings will have opened by then as well. We can start and complete our search, have you applied and approved in a matter of a week or two also. How about I reach out periodically and when move date is closer we’ll start our search. You’ll thank me for it I promise! Sound okay?",,,,,
Incoming,Okay! Thanks.,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Okay! Thanks.”,,,,,
Outgoing,My pleasure!,,,,,

I was just wondering as far as me looking at the places/reviews because i’ve started to actively look as far as location/reviews/price/style of the apartment and i’m not liking a huge bit of them so that was my only concern, not really on applying but mostly on not rushing into something during that time because i have no other choice. I’ve found a select few that I like as far as reviews, location, and style.",,,,,
Outgoing,I understand. What the max price you want to be at for rent? And what locations are you open to?,,,,,
Incoming,"Sq ft over 775
 Huge Walk In Closet, Huge/Modern Kitchen, Good Size Bedrooms/Bathroom, Preferably Carpet in the Bedroom, Generator Power in case of a Power outage, If possible a small desk area embedded in the apt 
 
 HAS TO BE A SAFE SAFE AREA!!
 Areas to search: Eado area, Pearland area, Sugarland area, Rice Village/River Oaks, Memorial area, Harris County, The Heights, West University Place, (Nice part) Bellaire/ Southside place
 
 Price point $ up to $1,800 (based on relevance to sq ft) 
  - Max is 17/18 only if the sq ft is over 900.",,,,,
Incoming,"Goodmorning, Am I able to recieve apartment help?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning Fran. Sorry, your previous message slipped by me! I’d be happy to help. Has anything changed about the apartment details you’re looking for since we last spoke?",,,,,
Incoming,The generator power part is not a huge necessity but it’d be nice if possible. The other options are extremely important though!! It could also be a 2 bedroom depending on price range and layout/sq ft but mostly looking for 1 bedroom.,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay got it. I’ll send some options today. Do you want to start touring this weekend?,,,,,
Incoming,Possibly Sunday/Monday,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay 👍🏼,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Okay 👍🏼 ”,,,,,
Outgoing,"Just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Prices shown are without specials and many are running specials (Ex. 6 weeks free) so monthly price will be lower when special is prorated

Outgoing,"Hey! Right, that was a preference, no? Or is that mandatory no carpet in the bedroom?",,,,,
Outgoing,"My emphasis with the units I sent was size for sure, but let me know if no carpet in the bedroom is a dealbreaker",,,,,
Incoming,"Yes, I wanted carpet in the bedrooms and only 2 I believe had them.",,,,,
Incoming,I would prefer it but size is also extremely important as well as closet,,,,,

 Broadstone Amarra - Loved B1 2 bedroom layout just hate there’s no balcony honestly would’ve put it over the top and been my choice!! Closet/Space is perfect!

 I just finished my tours for today. I liked the layout but the set up of the closets were pretty pretty small even in the largest 2 bedroom. I favorited another one on the shared site.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, thanks for the feedback. I’ll take a look at the other property you added and have it added to Dec 30th tours. Bare with me 🙏🏼 I’m traveling pretty much all day today",,,,,
Incoming,It’s okay! Is there a reason why I can’t schedule the tours myself from the ones you sent?,,,,,

Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning Fran, and happy holidays! Wanted to check and make sure you’re all good for your Dec 30th tours. Were you able to get all you need scheduled?",,,,,
Incoming,"Hello Ashanti! Happy Holidays, yes I am still going for the tours today. Do you have any other apartments to add to the list, I don’t think I’ve found the one that has a majority of everything I would desire in my next apartment. I could settle for the Broadstone but no balcony/carpet really sucks. So I would like if I could find an apartment with:
 - balcony, huge walk in closet, carpet in bedroom, huge modern kitchen",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Fran, sorry for the delay. I’ll take another look asap. I definitely want you to be all in on your decision. Enjoy your New Year!",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey Ashanti, 
 Happy New Year! and okay thanks!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Fran,
 Just ran another search and I still think the options we went over are your best choices. I added one more, East Bend, that is $1885 + 1 month free = $1727 when the special is prorated. 
 
 Let me know what you think and what your thoughts are right now considering all your options",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey, Ok I will check it out",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “Hey, Ok I will check it out”",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey Ashanti, I checked out East Bend but I wasn’t able to tour because there wasn’t any apartments available. They said they will notify me when they do, the same thing happened with 1810 Apartments as well.",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Fran, okay thanks for the heads up. Those are:
  
 The James River Oaks
 Broadstone Eado
 Virtuo Med Center
 Alexan junction heights
 Heights West end
 The exchange
 
 Let me know before you visit any others so I can send your guest card beforehand. I’ll see if anything else pops up this week",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey, that’s ookay I look at the reviews :///",,,,,
Outgoing,Right. Best on that list is Alexan Junction Heights,,,,,
Incoming,"Goodmorning, so there’s no other apartments to see?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning, so there’s a few mandatory things you want (sqft, carpet in bedroom, balcony, huge closet, etc) 
 
 With your budget we can get everything but the biggest compromise you’ll need to make is location. Unless you’re willing to compromise a balcony for two bedrooms at Broadstone Amarra. Or revisit Alta Sunset Heights where the issue there was closet space
 
 Throughout the search have you narrowed down areas you definitely want to stick to or know how far you’re willing to be from the city?",,,,,
Incoming,"It’s not necessarily about being in the city, I don’t care about that. It’s the not being too far away from my job that’s why I even offered spring branch/heights bc i want to be in the safer areas of houston without being so terribly far from my job downtown. The 2-3 places at the top right now are East Bend, Broadstone and 1810 but I was never able to actually tour any apartments in 1810 because he got the units wrong or something but I never received any contact back about the units to tour and that was two weeks ago. If I could I would move to Katy honestly but that is way too far from my job.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay got it, so for East Bend and 1810 Main the best units will be these below
 
 East Bend - A06D (886 sqft)- $1800 - Available 3/1 - Virtual walk-thru is on website 
 1810 Main - A6 (811 sqft) - $1900 - Available 3/11 (can ask for a 2 day extension from current apt) - Virtual walk-thru is on website 
 
 A few more to consider…
 
 Define Living at Brittmoore - 2 bed (1040 sqft)- $1850 - Available 3/19 (can ask for an extension from current apt)
 
 You also have The Westover at West branch . 2 bed under $1800 which you liked the layout but said closet space was small. I think the two closets combined are bigger than any one closet you’ll have plus sqft is 1185 which is probably about the largest unit for a new building under $1800 as close to Downtown as it is
 
 The Rosslyn Garden Oaks - A2 - 723 sqft - $1656
 
 Forth at Navigation - A4 - $1892 - More luxury building than we’ve been looking at (Exact layout: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CdgTmz1Dtiw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)
 
 Citadel - A5 - 918 sqft - $1569 - Available 3/11",,,,,
Outgoing,"I definitely recommend touring Citadel. It’s a smaller community, very clean and the unit they have is huge considering the price. Let me know if you want to tour any. A few in particular I will need to set up for you 👍🏼",,,,,
Incoming,"Citadel Reviews are extremely bad, that’s why I didn’t choose them the first time you showed them to me.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Understood, how about the other options mentioned?
 
 Have you seen the virtual tours for East Bend on the website? It’ll give you a great idea of if that floor plan will work for you. And 1810 Main is over $1800 so if you’re considering being over that amount I’d recommend Forth at Navigation over 1810 Main",,,,,
Incoming,"I still booked a tour with Citadel for later this afternoon but yeah based on how bad the reviews are for safety, I don’t think i’ll be going there. I went to east bend already. I said I couldn’t see the unit I wanted so I can’t choose the place if I don’t see the unit and the same thing happened with 1810 where there were no units to show which honestly didn’t make sense, in my opinion.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay. When you get to Citadel see if unit 304 is available to see. It’s the same floor plan as unit #328 that would work best but it shows it will be available tomorrow. 
 
 Not being able to see these units just means there are no vacant units for the floor plan you want. I’m not sure why they didn’t at least show you something. Worst case scenario should be you see a different unit so you can see finishes and then get sent video of the actual floor plan. Broadstone and many others you’ve toured don’t have that issue because they’re brand new and have a lot of vacant units.",,,,,
Outgoing,Please let me know your thoughts on Citadel after you’ve toured 👍🏼,,,,,
Incoming,"Hey Ashanti, I did like Citadel but the unit I wanted is unavailable for my moving date and he also confirmed the safety issues :/. Top 3 are still Broadstone, East Bend, and 1810 if I can see the unit.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, good morning. Okay. Can you let me know what floor plans from East Bend and 1810 you’re most interested in so I can see what I can do? The biggest issue is being able to get into a vacant unit. Would you be okay with a tour of the building, touring a similar (not exact) floor plan, and seeing video of your exact floor plan?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay got it, so now we’d be looking at 1810 only if you’re willing to be over $1800. East Bend had a A06D available for March under $1800 but was least today. And for 1810 for those floor plans you’re looking at an A6 for $1890. You can see the floorplan on the website. Just go to the A6 and click the “360” button. 
 
 I know you want to see the floor plans in person but they’re all occupied unfortunately. If you’re not comfortable applying based on video, which is understandable, we need to only consider apartments that have currently availability for the floor plans you’re interested in so you get to see a vacant unit.",,,,,
Incoming,How would the deals apply to that?,,,,,
Outgoing,1810 is not running any specials unfortunately,,,,,
Incoming,Oh dang :/,,,,,
Outgoing,I’ll run another search today. Truthfully we need to be creative about you seeing the exact unit and get video when we can’t. It’s very common to not be able to see the unit in person before applying. And in a way shows the demand for the apartment and specific unit,,,,,
Outgoing,"Let’s revisit Alta Sunset Heights and Artistry Design District. 
 
 Alta - A4, A4.1
 Artistry - A3",,,,,
Outgoing,Check the closets again for Alta:,,,,,
Outgoing,https://www.altasunsetheights.com/videos,,,,,
Incoming,I did check the closets. I have the in person videos in my camera roll. They are small,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. That leaves us with Broadstone where you’ll have 2 bedrooms but no balcony. Would you be happy with that set up?,,,,,
Incoming,Not necessarily that’s why I haven’t chose it.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Fran, 1810 Main is now running 1 month free on all 1 bedrooms. Let me know which your ideal floor plan is and I’ll see what can be done about seeing it.",,,,,
Outgoing,Their A8D seems like the perfect floorplan for you. Has a study + an extra closet space. It’s $2015 + 1 month free which would be $1880/mo. But they have other floorplans over 800 sqft for less,,,,,
Incoming,This is the floor plan. A5-A8D,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll check tomorrow with them to see what our touring options are",,,,,
Incoming,I booked a tour with them for today,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay sounds good, what time will you be touring? For them I’m required to tour with you but I can’t be there so will need to check in via FaceTime",,,,,
Incoming,"When I went there last time, I didn’t need a check in.",,,,,
Outgoing,"That’s their requirement for locators and it’s the only way they will pay me if you decide to lease with them. Last time you went, you went without telling me. They only need to see me, I won’t need to be on FaceTime the whole time",,,,,
Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Incoming,You booked my 1810 tour so i’m not sure what you mean,,,,,
Outgoing,"Different client I’m thinking about, I apologize.",,,,,
Outgoing,But it’s a requirement from the office. What time will you be touring?,,,,,
Outgoing,Have you verified they have units for you to see or should I still call? I don’t want the same thing to happen that happened last time,,,,,
Incoming,Do you have other apartments to show or was that the only ones?,,,,,
Outgoing,"You have Artistry Design District, 884 sqft for $1925 + 1 month free = $1764
 
 Also have a 2 bed for $2050 + 1 month free = $1879
 
 Lenox Heights - 834 sqft - $2085 + 1 month free = $1911
 
 Modera Garden Oaks - 897 sqft/ 1Bed + den - $1915 + 6 weeks free = $1709
 
 The Rosslyn at Garden Oaks - 849 sqft - $1839",,,,,
Outgoing,"You’ve already seen Artistry design, District. And Lennox Heights is above the price you wanted to pay. So I suggest seeing Madera Garden Oaks and Rosslyn at Garden Oaks.",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know your thoughts and I’ll schedule for you,,,,,
Outgoing,Also what time will you be touring today? The staff at 1810 has been told I’ll be on a quick FaceTime check in,,,,,
Outgoing,Just spoke with Juan at 1810 Main. Either him or Ayanna will be touring you today. They will have an A5 and A8D to show you,,,,,
Outgoing,Can you please share your tour time so I can be prepared for a quick FaceTime call? This is the only way I’m paid by 1810 Main for our work together,,,,,
Incoming,He said he already gave you the credit from when you called. You keep giving me apartments that I have already denied. The garden Oaks does not have good reviews. Ok,,,,,
Outgoing,"You have a number of non negotiables. Must have a balcony, must have carpet in the bed room, must have great reviews, must be over 800 sqft, must have a huge closet. And be under $1800
 
 Can you share what you’re looking for in reviews? Both garden oaks properties have 4.4 and 4.5 on google. I’m having you revisit properties because I’m sure you notice we have limited options based on what you’re looking for. I want very badly to find everything on your list",,,,,
Outgoing,And one thing I can’t rely on is a leasing agent to say they will give credit. Unfortunately that’s the nature of the apartment industry. I only ask for the favor of a quick FaceTime from you because for me it’s really important things are documented to cover my bases. We may run into that same scenario in the future and all I ask is that you please take 30 seconds for the office to see that I’m present. I want to help find exactly what you’re looking for and I just want to be sure I’m taken care of by the apartments also.,,,,,
Incoming,I mean a good half that you have sent me doesn’t have carpet but I am still checking them out even though that’s what I prefer. Actually reading the reviews and not just looking at the number is not great reviews.,,,,,
Incoming,Liked “And one thing I can’t rely on is a leasing agent to say they will give credit. Unfortunately that’s the nature of the apartment industry.

Outgoing,"I know reviews are very important to you, and I completely understand why. They can give great insights into a community. That said, I encourage you to look at the overall picture, focusing on the overall rating and consistent patterns rather than individual negative reviews. Every property will have a few one-star reviews, but that doesn’t mean the community as a whole isn’t great. The apartments I’ve sent you have excellent overall ratings, and visiting them in person can help us determine if they’re truly a good fit for you.",,,,,
Outgoing,"And just for insight. I’ve placed many clients at the apartments in Garden Oaks for example, and I always check in on my clients and none of them have had bad experiences at these two apartments in particular to date",,,,,
Outgoing,I’m not saying we have to see them but we need a different approach because you’re not completely sold on any apartment you’ve seen so far and you mentioned you’ve been actively looking since at least early November,,,,,
Incoming,"The “6 weeks” free rent amount you gave was that discounted to the whole lease term, the $1709?",,,,,
Incoming,Yeah I haven’t been sold bc the apartments are already breaching past my limit and i’m not getting what I wanted so I don’t want to spend past my limit for something I don’t like for however long the lease is,,,,,
Incoming,"Another one I’m adding to my top list is the Westover Branch 
 
 1. Broadstone 
 2. East Bend 
 3. West over 
 4. 1810
 
 Not in order just what I liked or willing to have to settle I guess",,,,,
Outgoing,The discount is now 8 weeks free so even cheaper and you would need to self pro-rate. So yes the special can be discounted for the whole lease term.,,,,,

 Lincoln Heights - 1 bed + study | $1708 + 6 weeks free | 914 sqft
 
 The Flats at West Alabama - 1 bed | $1836 | 927. Living space in this unit is gigantic, but closet space is small
 
 Grey House - 1 bed | $1777 | 813 sqft",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Fran, any feedback on the last few apts I shared?",,,,,
Incoming,Hey so currently i’m looking for two bedrooms under 1900 now since the one bedrooms i’ve been seeing are lacking.,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Not sure if you saw the two bedrooms at Westover at West branch when you toured but they have a 2 bedroom within price range. And then Avasa Spring Branch is a good one too.,,,,,
Incoming,Avasa is over 1900,,,,,
Outgoing,Their 2 bedrooms starting at $1899 + 1 month free,,,,,
Incoming,"Yes, on top of community fees as well",,,,,
Outgoing,So the budget isn’t $1900? What do you need the base rent price to be at for a two bedroom?,,,,,
Incoming,The budget is under 1900 not right at 1900. If the base rent is $1900 that’s not including everything else on top,,,,,
Outgoing,Are you saying that you need rent + all other monthly fees to be under $1900?,,,,,
Incoming,yes.,,,,,
Incoming,"I may need to revisit Artistry, Westover and any other nice 2 bedrooms you can tell me",,,,,
Outgoing,Would you be going for a 2 bedroom at Artistry too? Those start at $2025 before the special,,,,,
Incoming,Yes you’ve told me. I also already looked at one,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Which day this week would you like to tour?,,,,,
Incoming,Saturday,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay. Any time Saturday?,,,,,
Incoming,Yes,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “Yes ”,,,,,
Incoming,Do you know what credit score you will need for those apartments,,,,,
Outgoing,"At least 650 is preferred. But approval will be based on your overall credit worthiness (credit score, income, rental history, etc)",,,,,
Outgoing,Is credit an issue?,,,,,
Incoming,I’ve never used mine i’ve used my parents as a guarantor but i’m trying to see if that is still the case,,,,,
Incoming,because that will be extra money added to put someone down as a guarantor,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, about what is your credit score?",,,,,
Incoming,660,,,,,
Outgoing,You should be find on credit,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Fran can you tour Sunday as well?
 
 Artistry is fully booked Saturday so you can split them up 1 Saturday and 1 Sunday. Or do both on Sunday. Which is best?",,,,,
Incoming,What about Friday?,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “You should be find on credit ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Not for Artistry. Artistry has mornings tomorrow and a late opening at 4pm tomorrow. And then nothing available until Sunday,,,,,

 3pm – Artistry Design District”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning Fran, wanted to catch you before church. Please let me know your thoughts from today and yesterday. If I can help at all, don’t hesitate to reach out!",,,,,
Incoming,"Goodmorning, Will do",,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “Goodmorning, Will do”",,,,,
Incoming,Hello are you able to schedule artistry again for tomorrow? i wanted to see another layout,,,,,
Incoming,because the one i wanted is gone,,,,,
Outgoing,"Sure, what time do you want to tour?",,,,,
Incoming,12:00 PM,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I’ll have to see if they can make that work by calling when they open tomorrow at 9am. They’re showing fully booked tomorrow",,,,,
Outgoing,Do you want to schedule for another day as a backup and I call in tomorrow to see if we can make 12pm work?,,,,,
Incoming,yeah i guess tuesday,,,,,
Outgoing,"Tuesday they only have morning 9am,9:15, and 9:30 available. Do you want to schedule for Wednesday at 12pm? Wednesday is open",,,,,
Incoming,no i’ll be at work and ill be just getting off work that time tuesday,,,,,
Outgoing,They have Tuesday 9-9:30. Wednesday 10am-1pm. Thursday 9am-4pm. Friday 9am-5pm. Any of these times work?,,,,,
Incoming,friday at 2,,,,,
Incoming,but if they still have the b1 available,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, you’re scheduled for Friday @2pm. There are only 2 B1’s that would work for your move date and with so many tours they could go by then. I’ll call tomorrow and do my best to see if 12pm will work.",,,,,
Incoming,yes ik that’s why i wanted tomorrow,,,,,
Incoming,but she didn’t show me a b1 in the color that they do have today so thts why i need to go back,,,,,
Outgoing,If it turns out you can’t tour until Friday would you be open to applying with a video with the color they have and seeing it Friday? I wouldn’t want you to miss out on the floor plan you know you like,,,,,
Incoming,I only want to see the color if i’m going to settle for it but if i don’t like the color im not applying. I wanted the B1 in the blue that they had but it’s gone now since the last time I toured.,,,,,
Outgoing,,copy_08FAE0C2-69D0-48AB-B675-44759B780F14.MOV,,,,
Outgoing,This is the color,,,,,
Outgoing,Not the B1 but color it would be,,,,,
Incoming,yes i saw it in the b2,,,,,
Incoming,i need to see b1,,,,,
Outgoing,I only have video of the B1 in blue. I can ask for b1 in brown tomorrow,,,,,
Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning Fran, unfortunately there are no openings today and the office doesn’t have video of the B1 with brown finishes. They also said they don’t have a B1 with brown finishes to tour. They only have the model unit with Blue finishes to tour. I’m sorry. Are option is to apply to lock the unit in and wait until Feb 17 when one becomes available to tour before actually signing the lease",,,,,
Incoming,"Gm, ah okay. No I’m not wasting money on applying/admin fee if I end up not liking how the brown looks.",,,,,
Incoming,Do you have a video of the B4 at Modera?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Loved “Gm, ah okay. No I’m not wasting money on applying/admin fee if I end up not liking how the brown looks. ”",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me check,,,,,
Incoming,Liked “Let me check”,,,,,
Incoming,Do you have other apartments to show,,,,,
Outgoing,It would be some that we’ve seen already just different floor plans. The B6 at Alta Sunset Heights is only about a $30 price difference from the B1 at Artistry,,,,,
Outgoing,"Other than those, we’ve seen the best within price range. It’s unfortunate with Artistry that we can’t see the correct color scheme because it sounds like your favorite one so far",,,,,
Incoming,there’s no balcony at alta for some 2 bedrooms,,,,,
Incoming,Emphasized “Do you have a video of the B4 at Modera?”,,,,,
Incoming,"yeah but even if i did, artistry no longer has a deal for b1 so it would overall including apartments fees and rent be too much if there were no deals",,,,,
Incoming,"westover is the next option, it’s just really far from my job and they don’t have any elevators since i don’t want the first floor",,,,,
Outgoing,There’s no balcony for the B4 at Modera either,,,,,
Outgoing,In that case would you like to cancel the Friday tour with Artistry?,,,,,
Incoming,oh well nvm to that i didn’t look at the floor plan just the price and sq ft,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “oh well nvm to that i didn’t look at the floor plan just the price and sq ft”,,,,,
Incoming,if i can’t see the b1 unit like you said so there’s no point,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “if i can’t see the b1 unit so there’s no point ”,,,,,
Outgoing,Understood on Westover. It’s looking like our best option right now,,,,,
Incoming,it’s 40 minutes from my job,,,,,
Outgoing,"We’ve shut down all of the options for one reason or another. Balcony, small closet space, not being able to tour the unit, etc. And we’ve moved on to two bedrooms. There are only a few two bedrooms options within budget you’d consider so our options are to reconsider 1 bedrooms, consider Westover and be further from work, or consider a two bedroom closer to work that may not have a balcony.",,,,,
Incoming,"upon looking at recent reviews westover has had a few break ins within the last month, which does not make me feel good",,,,,
Incoming,you don’t have any other apartments ??,,,,,
Outgoing,Are you open to one bedrooms again?,,,,,
Incoming,I’m looking for 2 with balcony and everything else I needed before,,,,,
Incoming,Can you please check if Ascent by city centre has specials i couldn’t tell on their website,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “I’m looking for 2 with balcony and everything else I needed before ”,,,,,
Outgoing,No specials for Ascend at City Center unfortunately and their 2 bedrooms start at $2690,,,,,
Outgoing,How about Filament at the Grid?,,,,,
Incoming,How far is that from downtown,,,,,
Incoming,Do they have specials?,,,,,
Incoming,"I am interested based off their pictures online, can you set a tour for tomorrow at 2?",,,,,
Outgoing,You’re scheduled for tomorrow at 2pm. It’s 25 mins from Downtown and they are running 6 weeks free,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “You’re scheduled for tomorrow at 2pm. It’s 25 mins from Downtown and they are running 6 weeks free”,,,,,
Incoming,"Great, Thank you!",,,,,
Incoming,Do you know if they have garage parking?,,,,,
Outgoing,My pleasure! No garage parking but it is gated. They have personal garages and carports for rent,,,,,
Incoming,Haha yes the personal garages is what i meant not garage parking,,,,,
Outgoing,Oh oh yes they do! I believe the price is $175,,,,,
Incoming,oooh okok!,,,,,
Incoming,,Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 2.26.28 AM.jpeg,,,,
Incoming,heey is there anyway you can see if they’ll still do the $1000,,,,,
Incoming,Also can you send some apartments in sugarland,,,,,
Outgoing,They’re doing a $500 look & lease on top of the 6 weeks free free but only for move ins by 2/21.,,,,,
Outgoing,"And there are notoriously limited apartments in Sugarland. These are the best there are and they are bunched together all within a mile of each other. 
 
 -Filament at the grid (you’re seeing today)
 -Arc at the grid
 -Lenox at the grid
 -1879 at the grid",,,,,
Outgoing,Let me know if you want to add any to tour today,,,,,
Incoming,Arc at the Grid at 2:30?,,,,,
Incoming,Liked “They’re doing a $500 look & lease on top of the 6 weeks free free but only for move ins by 2/21.”,,,,,
Outgoing,There’s a 3:15. We can schedule that one and you can walk in early,,,,,
Incoming,Okay,,,,,
Outgoing,Scheduled for 3:15,,,,,
Incoming,Thanks!,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course!,,,,,
Incoming,I couldn’t see the prices online for Arc everything just says “contact us”,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7392.PNG,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7391.PNG,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7390.PNG,,,,
Outgoing,"B1 - $1999
 B2 - $2034
 B3 - $2109
 They have an 1 bed A10 (800 sqft) might be worth seeing too - $1685",,,,,
Incoming,Does Arc have specials?,,,,,
Incoming,"Liked “B1 - $1999
 B2 - $2034
 B3 - $2109
 They have an 1 bed A10 (800 sqft) might be worth seeing too - $1685”",,,,,
Outgoing,They may be running 2 weeks free. You’ll need to confirm with the office when you tour though,,,,,
Outgoing,Filament has the best special right now,,,,,
Incoming,Okay,,,,,
Outgoing,How did it go today??,,,,,
Incoming,The specials are with conditions,,,,,
Incoming,They said the prices are at a “reduced rate” so everything isn’t 6 weeks free,,,,,
Outgoing,Mmmm so it’s only the more expensive floor plans. How about their A8 floorplan? You’d be back to the original 1 bedroom but 959 sqft is gigantic. You’d have a really big living area,,,,,
Outgoing,,IMG_2595.PNG,,,,
Incoming,also arc prices are off as well from what you told me,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7429.heic,,,,
Incoming,Do you happen to have a video of Arcs 1193 sq ft floor plan?,,,,,
Outgoing,They didn’t show you best prices. All those prices for the Arc they showed you is for 12 months. Best price is on 14 months,,,,,
Outgoing,No I don’t have video. Let me see if I can get it,,,,,
Incoming,It was some new lady didn’t know much,,,,,
Incoming,wasn’t that great at answering questions but she was new,,,,,
Incoming,please,,,,,
Outgoing,No video. I’ll call tomorrow to see if they have it to send,,,,,
Incoming,Ok,,,,,
Incoming,Today was just very hard,,,,,
Incoming,There are two floor plans i really like from filament but one the kitchen layout is small and the other i wish it was bigger but still nice,,,,,
Incoming,Stafford texas isn’t also that safe,,,,,
Outgoing,Is one of those the B2?,,,,,
Outgoing,Who told you Stafford isn’t safe?,,,,,
Incoming,"Any other places in the heights, memorial, west university, sugarland?",,,,,
Incoming,they said it’s less than 10 minutes from a terribly unsafe area,,,,,
Incoming,b1 and b4,,,,,
Incoming,Hi do you mind contacting artistry if they have specials bc the automated email person is now saying they have specials on all but i thought it was specific ones,,,,,
Incoming,,Gmail.jpeg,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, okay will do. Just tried a few times and no answer but will let you know when I get through",,,,,
Outgoing,I’ve also still been looking. Will let you know if anything pops up,,,,,
Incoming,"Loved “Hey, okay will do. Just tried a few times and no answer but will let you know when I get through”",,,,,

Outgoing,Good morning! These are Beckett Cottingham. But they have no balconies,,,,,
Outgoing,The other two are Kingsley at Shadow Creek,,,,,
Outgoing,"Also Artistry wasn’t answering, I called about 8 times yesterday but I’ll get in touch today",,,,,
Incoming,"Goodmorning, I got in touch with artistry through email",,,,,
Incoming,Oh okayw dang,,,,,
Incoming,Have you heard of Rye heights and lenox heights,,,,,
Outgoing,"Liked “Goodmorning, I got in touch with artistry through email ”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes I have, their two bedrooms will be out of our price range unfortunately",,,,,
Incoming,ofcourse,,,,,
Outgoing,Did you get the clarity of Artistry specials you were looking for?,,,,,
Incoming,yes,,,,,
Outgoing,"And, not the right price?",,,,,
Outgoing,Is Filament at the Grid first at this point?,,,,,
Incoming,there is no deal for artistry,,,,,
Incoming,its first but the one i really really like is the stairs building on the 3rd floor and im moving by myself so i dont want to do that but the one i like is in the elevator building but a smaller unit and more expensive bc of the “reduced rate” plans,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay I see.,,,,,
Incoming,Do you give rebates?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes, $200 cash sent via Zelle",,,,,
Incoming,"Okay, for filament is it 2x the rent or 3x the rent?",,,,,
Outgoing,Filament will be 3x the rent. Calculated from gross monthly income,,,,,
Incoming,Well it says denied before I even put my income in,,,,,
Incoming,so I guess I will need a guarantor,,,,,
Outgoing,Is there anything else on your background that you think is the cause?,,,,,
Incoming,,IMG_7649.PNG,,,,
Incoming,"I didn’t even do my income stubs yet but this could be “declined” from the initial application since I was told by the leasing person to wait for a separate email from them and not put my income on the application, now that i think about it",,,,,
Incoming,because also told me it would take 3 days and i applied last night while at work,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay you’d want to communicate that to the office and ask what can be done,,,,,
Incoming,Yea,,,,,
Incoming,I am also still getting emails about a tour from artistry did you not cancel it a few weeks ago?,,,,,
Outgoing,Disregard the emails,,,,,
Outgoing,Do you know what Filament means by “rental history does not meet property require requirements?” Were there any late payments or broken leases in your rental history?,,,,,
Incoming,How old is the filament?,,,,,
Outgoing,2023 build,,,,,
Outgoing,Questioned “Do you know what Filament means by “rental history does not meet property require requirements?” Were there any late payments or broken leases in your rental history?”,,,,,
Outgoing,Can you please answer my last question so I know what I’m up against and how I can get you approved?,,,,,

Incoming,There is nothing to answer. I’ve been approved before without help besides my parents as guarantors. Please stop getting snappy over text messages. I have ignored it before but it’s rude and unprofessional.,,,,,
Incoming,You ned to fill out parts of the form with your information and send it back to me.,,,,,
Outgoing,I’m trying to help is all and wanting to understand the denial. I apologize if I haven’t been patient,,,,,
Outgoing,The pdf doc isn’t letting me in to sign anything,,,,,
Outgoing,"If you’re in you can list my info:
 
 Ashanti DePass",,,,,
Outgoing,"Oh, this isn’t for me to sign. It’s for you to fill out. 
 
 Just check that you were referred. And then in the Locator/Real estate agent box list : Ashanti DePass
 
 The bottom piece under your signature is for the office",,,,,
Incoming,Oh okay.,,,,,
Incoming,"All it is is my dad had a collection on his account from old apartment move out fees 4 years ago and he didn’t pay it so it got added to my account but i already paid it, i just needed to give them the letter and receipt and dispute it with the rental third party",,,,,
Incoming,"Liked “Oh, this isn’t for me to sign. It’s for you to fill out. 
 
 Just check that you were referred. And then in the Locator/Real estate agent box list : Ashanti DePass
 
 The bottom piece under your signature is for the office ”",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, that’s great info for me to know. Thanks for explaining",,,,,
Incoming,Also so since the rent is 2050x3 but the last two pay stubs may not equal the “3x” bc nurses checks fluctuate so it equals like $5985 and the income is $6150,,,,,
Incoming,at first i thought it was 2.5 not 3 that’s why i checked again,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay I see, so with your father as guarantor to boost income and with the collections paid off you’re saying this next time around your application should be good?",,,,,
Incoming,no my question is would i still be accepted if its not the exact 6150?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Oh, it’s unlikely. You’d want to use your father’s income if possible alongside your own. Apts are really strict with income requirements. I’ve seen exceptions if income is less than $100 under but it would need to be signed off by management and very rare.",,,,,
Incoming,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFx2iwmuSzA/?igsh=MXF6bG5jejJhOWwxMg==,,,,,
Incoming,what is this place called,,,,,
Outgoing,Lenox Grand West. It’s far out in Katy,,,,,
Incoming,lol ofcourse it is,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey, making sure all is good. Where do you stand with everything?",,,,,
Incoming,hey waiting on rentgrow to complete the dispute,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, sounds good",,,,,
Incoming,"Hey Ashanti, just to update my dispute got approved!",,,,,
Outgoing,That’s amazing!! Where are you will everything now?,,,,,
Incoming,I am just waiting for my approval letter to be sent,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay perfect, keep me in the loop!",,,,,
Incoming,"Emphasized “Okay perfect, keep me in the loop!”",,,,,
Incoming,Approval letter was sent!,,,,,
Outgoing,That’s awesome!! Congratulations!! Finally through the finish line lol,,,,,
Incoming,Lawd tell me about it!,,,,,
Incoming,Now how do I make sure they put your name down,,,,,
Outgoing,There would’ve been a place on the application that asked how you heard about the property or who were you referred by. Did you come across that?,,,,,
Incoming,The only thing I had was the document I sent you,,,,,
Incoming,and I turned it in but I will double check the application as well,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, I should be good either way but thanks for double checking",,,,,
Incoming,Yeah I checked and it wasn’t in there,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, thanks for checking. When you get a chance can you send me this info so I can initiate your $200 rebate…

 In the mean time, I’ll still be here to assist however I can so please reach out if there’s anyway I can help at all",,,,,
Incoming,"Okay Thanks!, what invoice?",,,,,
Incoming,Also how old is the Filament?,,,,,
Outgoing,Between my company and Filament. They pay my company a referral fee and that’s what your rebate is paid out of. Filament was built in 2023,,,,,

 What areas are you considering?",,,,,
Incoming,"I’m looking in the inner loop areas specifically Galleria, uptown , memorial, Montrose, midtown, Heights, post/river Oaks",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, what’s max rent you’re wanting to have per month? 
 
 You also mentioned you want to move more toward March. Do you have a current lease that’ll be ending or is the move date flexible?",,,,,
Incoming,"I was saying my max would be 1600 a month, my move date is flexible",,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay got it. At $1600 max you’d want your gross monthly income to be at least $4800 per month to be approved. Is that okay?
 
 Also do you have any broken leases or criminal background that could prevent you from being approved?",,,,,
Incoming,Yes that’s fine and no broken leases or background,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning. Okay sounds perfect, I’ll send you some options shortly!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Some prices you’ll see above $1600 but that is before any specials. 
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 I’m able to do that when you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Incoming,Okay awesome perfect!! I’ll take a look and get back to you !,,,,,
Outgoing,Loved “Okay awesome perfect!! I’ll take a look and get back to you ! ”,,,,,

Incoming,Okay awesome! Appreciate that,,,,,
Incoming,I’m guessing it’s too soon to do the move lol,,,,,
Outgoing,"Of course! Good morning, so the free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate because the move never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay a move deposit plus the balance and you usually just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out.",,,,,

Outgoing,Don’t mention it!,,,,,
Outgoing,Hey Autumn! Wanted to check in real quick. A couple of my teammates said you filled out forms and might be moving sooner than anticipated. Will you be moving before you lease is up at Harlow?,,,,,
Incoming,"Hey Ashanti! Thanks for reaching out. Yeah, I inquired again because I have to relocate for work to Austin so I have to break my lease and move before the end of the year",,,,,
Outgoing,Got you! When exactly do you need to move by?,,,,,
Incoming,By December,,,,,
Outgoing,Got it. What areas of Austin are you open to? Is the a work address you’d like to be close to?,,,,,
Outgoing,And I see budget at $1500. Is that your strict max or is there any flexibility?,,,,,
Incoming,"Ok so here’s where my office is,(send a pic on maps) , since I heard it was pretty bad traffic I’d like to be in close proximity of the office",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hey Edwin, hope all is well! I just wanted to check in and make sure all is the same since we last spoke. Is the plan still to visit Houston 12/9-12/11 to tour apartments?",,,,,
Incoming,"Wasup Ashanti. I’m so sorry for the delay, this week has been kickin my ass. I thought I responded. Yes, those are still the dates I’m going to be in Houston to tour apartments.",,,,,
Outgoing,"No worries man, hopefully you get a day to yourself over the wknd. Sounds good though. I’ll still reach out toward the end of this month to get you going. You’ll be all scheduled for your tours when you touch down 👌🏽",,,,,
Incoming,"I appreciate you.
 
 You mind if I ask how it works so I know how to schedule my time there",,,,,
Outgoing,"For sure. 
 
 Yea, I’ll get clear on exactly what you’re looking for and send you a list of options available for February, toward the end of this month/Dec 1st. From the list, you’ll choose which you want to tour and me and my team will schedule tours for you based on the most convenient driving routes. From touring, you’ll likely want to decide within 48 hours of tours since that’s how long apartments will honor prices from your tour date if they happen to change. 
 
 You’d apply and have your move date set and any questions or concerns along the way I’d be around to help with or help you communicate with your new apartment leasing staff when needed",,,,,
Incoming,Thank you. This is perfect.,,,,,
Incoming,"If I see a property on someone else’s IG, do you think you’ll know which property it is?",,,,,
Outgoing,"You’re welcome man. And yes, more than likely",,,,,
Incoming,Ok. Thank you.,,,,,
Outgoing,Liked “Ok. Thank you. ”,,,,,
Incoming,Good Morning Ashanti. I reached out to you about a month ago to help me locate a new apartment for my move back to Houston 2/1/25. Just wanted to remind you that I’m going to be in Houston for a few days next week to tour apartments. Do you think you can help me set something up for Monday 12/9? Thanks again.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good Morning Edwin, yes for sure! We didn’t really go over what you were looking for if you can help me out with that.

Incoming,Do I need to do anything get off his list?,,,,,
Outgoing,"I’ll reach out to him. Give me a minute, if you’re under another name you don’t show up when I’m trying to search for you and makes it difficult all around.",,,,,
Incoming,Lmk what you need me to do. I would prefer to work with you.,,,,,
Outgoing,Got you. No worries. I just need to have you switched over. You’re not obligated to work with someone you don’t want to,,,,,
Incoming,Ok thanks. If you need me to message anyone to confirm just lmk.,,,,,
Outgoing,Got you. Thanks.,,,,,
Outgoing,"All set! I just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Lots of great options but one of my favorite floor plans for the price is at Forth at Navigation. You get high ceilings and big windows, plus the gym is great for content. 
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 (or more) you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up for when you’re in town!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 I can do that when you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you!",,,,,

Incoming,See this is perfect. Do you know of any others on the list you sent that have similar floor plans,,,,,
Outgoing,"Forth might be my favorite. I’d say Catalyst and Drewery Place will offer similar luxury. 
 
 These are brand new buildings: Alta Sunset Heights, Artistry Design District, Emeline Heights, Lenox Heights, Rye Heights
 
 Alexan Junction Heights is in a shopping lot with Target, Kroger and lots of other stores so very convenient location. 
 
 If the in unit Aesthetic is what you want, I’d lean toward Forth, Catalyst, or Drewery Place but Forth is still my favorite",,,,,
Incoming,I really appreciate this. So you def understand what I’m looking! This was a great first pick.,,,,,
Incoming,Do you want me to use the email link to choose? Or should I send you the names via text?,,,,,
Outgoing,Absolutely! You can’t beat just text me,,,,,
Incoming,"Ok, and if I find a property myself can you schedule that as well so you get the credit?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Yes, anything you find or want me to schedule just send my way!",,,,,
Incoming,https://maps.app.goo.gl/LnhdhGKhkThUKbEVA?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy,,,,,
Incoming,"Ok. This is where I lived before moving back to Philly. If I don’t love anything while touring, I don’t mind going back here. So however you have to put your name to get the credit this my safe bet.",,,,,

Incoming,What you think as far as what I’m looking for? Any of them worth looking at ?,,,,,
Outgoing,"I don’t think so. We can do better. Some of the best deals right now are all the new construction in the Heights
 
 Rye Heights has a nice floorplan with a wrap around balcony that’s within price range after specials. 
 
 We mentioned Artisrty Design district and then Lenox Heights is brand new also
 
 My personal favorite layout is still Forth at Nav though. Love the high ceilings and may be bias because I’m familiar with management also and they’re always on point in my opinion",,,,,

Incoming,Ok. Thanks!,,,,,
Outgoing,Of course!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey! So both Lenox Heights and Rye Heights aren’t open for tours just yet. New info to me, i’m sorry! Lenox is aiming for Thursday or Friday but won’t know until later in the week, and Rye only conducts hard hat tours on Saturdays from 10-4. 
 
 I can do a virtual tour for you since you’ll be headed back out of town, if that works?",,,,,
Incoming,"Thanks for that. I think we have good options actually those two were at the bottom of my list so no problem. 
 
 If we can move pearl rosemont right before eats bend instead that would be great. That way I can finish up earlier",,,,,

Incoming,"Honestly the ONE thing I’d change here are the floor layouts.
 They’re all kind of the same nothing too crazy.
 
 I like the layouts with the corner units and really open tall windows, pillars etc.

Incoming,Hi Ashanti sorry busy work week! Yes does this property have 1 bedrooms ? That’s what I’m needing I’m open location wise.,,,,,
Outgoing,No worries! Yes they do. 1 bedrooms are currently at $1140 + 1 month free. How soon do you need to move? And what price point do you need to stay under?,,,,,
Incoming,I’m looking to move as soon as possible. I applied somewhere it fell through because the income verification has been taking almost a month and I need to leave my current lease. That price point is good depending on if the properties are requesting 2.5 or 3x the rent. If 2.5 i can be more flexible.,,,,,
Outgoing,Got it. I know you’re open to location but is there a location that’s ideal? Close to a work or school address or address you visit frequently and want to be close to?,,,,,
Outgoing,And whats your gross monthly income? So I know what apartments I can get you approved at,,,,,

I just went and looked at Birchway and I actually applied to their other location and that’s the reason why I’m looking for somewhere new is because I was being held up with their income verification, but since this one doesn’t require all that I think I really wanna live here. I’m still going to the other place that you sent me for today, but I’m gonna apply to this one asap as an option",,,,,

Outgoing,"Good morning! Thanks for reaching out, Elyshia told me you would be. Please, call me Ashanti. How soon will you be moving to Houston?",,,,,
Incoming,Ok no worries I will be moving to Houston on the 19th. So I would like to have some rentals lined up to tour.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay got it. Can you tell me more of what you’re looking for?
 
 - # of bedrooms
 - areas/neighborhoods/work address
 - max budget
 - any specifics(sqft requirements, pet friendly, certain amenities, etc)",,,,,
Incoming,"I'm looking for:
 
 • 2-3 bed 2 bathroom 
 
 • No more than 30 minutes from my work address. Either in the north Houston area where there is low crime. Spring or Conroe area. Flexible as long as it's in a low crime area.
 
 • Also consideration for no rent increase for rental if possible. 
 
 • (work address) 900 WEST RANKIN ROAD, HOUSTON, TX 77067
 
 • Max budget is 1650
 
 • Pet friendly, 2 car garage minimum 1200 sqft. Laundry room, patio and preferred a fenced backyard.",,,,,
Outgoing,"It sounds like you may be wanting a private rental and not an apartment, is that right?",,,,,
Incoming,If possible yes,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning ☀️ Okay, what I’ll do is send what is within your budget. I don’t do private rentals unfortunately and the 2-3 bed private rentals within that budget will be very old. I’ll send apartments but they will all be newer, close to your job and I’ll be looking for space (above 1200 sqft). That sound okay?",,,,,
Incoming,Good morning that works for me thank you.,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay perfect. Can I have your first and last name and good email to send everything?,,,,,
Incoming,"Tanequa Browne
 
 tanequab@gmail.com",,,,,
Outgoing,"Got it thanks! I just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Some prices you’ll see above $1650 but that is before any specials are applied
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them ip for when you’re in Houston!",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 I’m able to do that when you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Incoming,Awesome thank you will start looking at the options you sent me. I will let you know which ones catch my interest. Also do you know if there will be a rent increase for the lease renewals? That is one of my concerns also especially if the price is at my max amount.,,,,,
Incoming,Also I forgot to mention a balcony as a feature if possible.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Sounds good. There’s usually a rent increase in line with the market change but I wouldn’t base your decision on it. Most renters fail to negotiate their renewal rate and it’s always negotiable. I always negotiate and rarely have seen an increase over $50 because of it. 
 
 Most of your list has balconies. Those that DON’T start with:
 Allora
 Birchway
 Prose
 The Standard",,,,,
Incoming,Ok because that's a concern for me especially if the rent price is at my max. I selected the ones I'm interested in through the link you sent me.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Totally understand. You’ll just want to negotiate when it’s time to renew, and I can help with that. Okay, I’ll have them set up for when you arrive. Will you want to start touring immediately the day after you arrive on the 20th?",,,,,
Incoming,Ok awesome because I'm currently in the military and my Basic housing allowance is 1645. I really don't want to over that amount. I would want to start touring on the 20th anytime after 12:00.,,,,,
Outgoing,Okay got it,,,,,
Incoming,Good Afternoon how are you? Sorry for the late response I've been on the road with this crazy fire and weather. Are there any updates with the Apartments?,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good afternoon Tanequa. Omg I didn’t know you were coming from CA. I’m glad to hear you’re okay. 
 
 No updates yet, you’ll be all scheduled well before you arrive to Houston. When I have your final schedule I’ll text you the details",,,,,
Outgoing,"Also from the options you choose, it might be worth considering Alta Cypress Springs, Alta Seargeant, Grove East, and San Palmas. All 2 beds under budget and newer buildings. Let me know if you’d like to add any of these to the list of tours",,,,,
Incoming,Good evening yes I left yesterday and I was driving through LA. The smoke from the fires looked crazy. The air quality was terrible also. I made it to Ft. bliss today so I'm still doing good with my route to Houston.,,,,,
Incoming,I checked out the apartments you advised me to consider and the only one I really like is Grove East. The others are still on the high end for my budget.,,,,,
Outgoing,"That’s so unfortunate. Praying for the best. I’m really glad to hear you’re okay. 
 
 Okay, I’ll add Grove East to the list. Pointing out that Alta Seargeant is running a special up to 8 weeks free plus $1000 move-in credit. Price for 2 bedrooms would be $1545 + 2 months free = $1339 per month with special prorated. I’d need to verify the special first but amazing price. 
 
 And Alta Cypress Springs is running a special of up to six weeks free plus $1000 move in credit. Price for two bedrooms would be $1645 + 6 weeks free = $1455 per month when special is prorated. I’d need to verify the special here too. Just a few things to consider, specials can be really helpful.",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Tanequa, here is your touring schedule for your upcoming visit:
 
 Monday, January 20 
 1 PM – Grove East

Outgoing,The pleasure is mine! I’m excited for us to find the right place,,,,,
Incoming,Yes I'm excited as well. Also I wanted to let you know I was also looking at some townhomes in the spring area that I'm interested in. I reached out to them awhile ago and they responded. Just wanted to give you an update just in case I go with the townhome.,,,,,
Outgoing,"Noted, thanks for the heads up!",,,,,
Incoming,No problem!,,,,,
Outgoing,"Good morning Tanequa! Some not so good news about our tours today. Many offices are closed for the holiday and closing because of the weather coming. Our tours are affected and won’t be open today or tomorrow and Wednesday is a toss up :/ I’m sorry. We’re going to have to completely reschedule for later this week. 
  
 Safest will be starting tours on Thursday since Wednesday is unknown. I’m really sorry. And to prepare you for what you may see, Houston is not a city that is prepared for snow, ice, etc. so when it comes, many businesses shut down and everybody stays home until it’s over. 
 
 I’m really sorry again, and as of right now our best option is to reschedule for Thursday but judging by tomorrow I’ll see if offices may be open Wednesday. That sound okay?",,,,,
Incoming,"Good afternoon how are you? Thank you for the update it's no worries and I understand. Hopefully the weather doesn't get too bad. 
 
  I did receive a response back from the townhomes and I will be going with them.",,,,,
Incoming,I really appreciate your help and I hope we can still stay in contact as I can refer you to someone in the future for you.,,,,,
Outgoing,"I’m good, thanks for asking. Yea I’m hoping it doesn’t either. That’s amazing! I’m glad you found the right place. 
 
 It’s been my pleasure to help. And yes please do stay connected. If you or anyone else needs help in the future, I’d be happy to help!",,,,,

Outgoing,"Hi Jamie! its Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment. I just need to clarify a few things from your form submission. 
 
 How soon do you need to move? Do you have a lease ending or no lease?",,,,,
Incoming,Thank you so much for responding back! I need to move within the next 30 days. My lease is up now and I was going to renew but the storm damaged the home so I’m needing to move last minute,,,,,
Outgoing,"Of course! Ah okay, I’m sorry to hear the circumstances having you move. What areas/neighborhoods are you looking to live?",,,,,

Outgoing,Absolutely!,,,,,
Incoming,Loved “Absolutely!”,,,,,
Incoming,"Good morning, 
 The Oliver had two available for my preferred move in. So they are an option. 
 The Laura had this perfect corner unit immediate move in. 
 The forth at navigation didn’t have any 2/2 and they were so perfect omg. The color scheme I wanted and everything I was even willing to pay the $2900 but they didn’t have none available until Sept. plus the B1 I really wanted was gone until next year. So today I have one at the the standard on the river i listed your name because it was across the street from the Laura. I will be making my choices after today if we don’t have any more options",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Jamie,
 Okay, thats sounds perfect. I wish so much that Forth had availability for you! Nonetheless, you still have great options. I think these are our options unless you decided to go up on budget. Let me know what you decide after you’ve seen everything!",,,,,
Incoming,Yes that’s what i said. I’m touring the last one today,,,,,

Incoming,Ok perfect. Thank you so much,,,,,
Outgoing,Happy I can help! Thank you,,,,,
Outgoing,Good morning Jamie ☀️ Just wanted to make sure all went well without any hiccups. Were you able to submit your application okay?,,,,,

Outgoing,These are Art House Sawyer Yards,,,,,
Outgoing,"Okay, most times when I have a client wait on an application they’re not 100% sold on their unit yet. Anything Standard doesn’t have that you wish it did?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Hey Jamie, making sure you’re all good. Are we still set on the Standard?",,,,,
Outgoing,"Questioned “Hey Jamie, making sure you’re all good. Are we sti…”",,,,,
Incoming,Yes my apologies! Because I haven’t looked anywhere else,,,,,
Outgoing,"No worries! I just wanted to you to be all set for your upcoming move. I’ve run a few searches since and still think the deal at Standard is top notch. 
 
 That B1 at Forth at Navigation is available 8/31 also for $3083. Think we mentioned it before that it may be a little too far out for you and price has gone up a bit",,,,,
Incoming,Loved “No worries! I just wanted to you to be all set for…”,,,,,

Outgoing,Yes there’s a B1 available 8/31 for $3083,,,,,

Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice).

Lead,I can do two tomorrow and then knock the other two out on Saturday.,,,,,

The Dacoma",,,,,
Lead,If we can view those apartments within a two time frame yes.. I have plans at 5 😂,,,,,
Agent,Lol we can stick to two in that case. I’ll get them scheduled. Just let me know how you want to split up the others since there are 5 more you want to see,,,,,
Lead,Kidding! I was able to move my plans so I can see the third option if you’re still able to schedule a tour. ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll schedule them all in the morning!",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Delani, here’s your schedule for today!

3pm - Timbergrove Station
4pm - Bellrock Memorial

The Dacoma only had a 1:30pm available so we’ll need to schedule those another day along with the others. Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Lead,Hi! Do we meet in the leasing office or just text when I’m in the parking lot? ,,,,,
Agent,I won’t be there today so you’ll just go into the office and let them know you have an appointment. I’ll be available for you to call/text though so just reach out if you run into any issues or have questions! 😌,,,,,
Lead,Awesome! Thank you!!! ,,,,,
Agent,My pleasure!!,,,,,
Lead,"Hey! If you haven’t already would you mind setting the next tour appointments for next Tuesday and Wednesday instead of for today? I’ve had family come into town so I won’t be as available as planned. 

I did however like the tours I went on yesterday!!",,,,,
Agent,Okay will do! I’m happy to hear tours went well! Enjoy your family time!,,,,,
Agent,"Morning Delani, you’re all set for today and tomorrow. Here’s the schedule below:

Tuesday, June 10
3 PM – the Dacoma 
4 PM – Co-op farmers market 

Wednesday, June 11 
4 PM – Vibe Med center 
5 PM – Prose South Main 

*We’re still trying to confirm Prose Hardy Yards for 3 PM tomorrow. I’ll follow up when it’s scheduled. Good luck touring and let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Delani, Prose Hardy Yards was confirmed so you’re all good for 3pm 👌🏼",,,,,
Lead,"Awesome! I might not be able to view Prose South Main, but I will be sure to visit the other two on the list. ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, sounds good. Let me know your thoughts!",,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti! I loved the apartments you’ve sent me. The three that stood out in person were :
- The Dacoma 
- Prose
-Timbergrove Station 


I do have a request if possible. When I mentioned my price rate, I was hoping that with everything included (rent, community fees, parking add ons) would be a total of 1350 per month instead of 1350 being the base pay and then the extra fees added. If you’re able to, I don’t mind broadening the search or looking at outskirts that allow me to live within those means. I’m willing to commute 30 minutes from my Job, just to see if there are any apartments with availability. ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay great! Yes, no problem. I’ll send some options. Some might be income restricted and require a very specific income to qualify for lower rent. What’s your gross monthly income?",,,,,
Lead,"If we’re going off of base pay after tax, $2600 a month but I do work overtime regularly and that generates an extra $400",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I think a great option for you will be 5550 northwest crossing. They have units over 800 square feet for $1135 and they won’t be too far from work for you",,,,,
Lead,I’d love to see it! ,,,,,
Agent,Does tomorrow after 3pm work for you?,,,,,
Lead,Yes ,,,,,
Agent,There’s a 3pm and a 4pm. Which do you prefer?,,,,,
Lead,3,,,,,
Agent,"You’re all set for tomorrow at 3pm!

55fifty Northwest Crossing

5550 Bingle Road
Houston, TX 77092",,,,,
Agent,"Unit #0131 is $1135 available 7/5
They should be able to hold it for the end of August. Inquire about this one if they start talking about more expensive units",,,,,
Lead,Thank you !,,,,,
Agent,Happy to help!,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti! I absolutely loved 55 fifty and put in an application for the apartment you suggested yesterday. I made sure to put you down in the apartment locator spot, now I’m just waiting for the application to be approved. I will update you once I know, thank you again!",,,,,
Agent,Sounds perfect!! Pleasure’s all mine. Please update me when they get back to you. I’ll be here if you need!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Delani, just wanted to check on you. Are you still waiting on 55fifty?",,,,,
Lead,"Hello! Yes and no, they asked me for my identity verification items yesterday. So now I’m waiting to hear back with the next steps.",,,,,
Agent,Okay so things are moving along. Sounds great! I’m here if you need,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti! I got approved for the apartment, I’ll be sitting down to look the lease later today but I wanted to give you an update",,,,,
Agent,That’s amazing! Congratulations!! I’m really happy we made it happen,,,,,
Agent,"When you’re able to sit down and look please send these details so I can initiate your $200 rebate 😌

Unit #
Move date
Lease term
Base rent amount
Any specials received",,,,,
Lead,"Awesome I will be sure to let you know, just wondering if the free move was still an option as well",,,,,
Agent,"Perfect. The free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate because the move never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay a move deposit and the difference of the credit and you just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out.",,,,,
Lead,"Okay thank you for breaking it down for me, I’ll take the $200 😂",,,,,
Agent,Lol absolutely!,,,,,
Agent,Morning Dalani☀️ Making sure your lease was correct and you were able to get it signed. Quick follow up for this info as well when you get a chance 😌,,,,,
Lead,"Omg I’m sorry I signed it this weekend, I’ll send you the details once I get off at 2:30",,,,,
Agent,No worries! I know things get busy. Okay sounds perfect ,,,,,
Lead,"Unit # - Apt 631
Move date - 8/14/25
Lease term - 12 months 
Base rent amount - $1290
Any specials received - October rent free",,,,,
Agent,"Thank you! For your $200 rebate, you’ll be paid via Zelle using the number we have on file. You’ll be paid when the property pays and the same day as me. That’s generally 60-90 days from move-in so usually a nice surprise. I’ll still be here to help throughout your lease so if you have any questions or concerns never hesitate to reach out!",,,,,

Agent,"Hey LaShaune, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form! I’m excited to help you find your next apartment and share any info from my Instagram page!
 
What areas/neighborhoods are you considering? ",,,,,
Lead,"I’m in River Oaks, so maybe the areas around there the heights and those kinds of areas?

At least 1000 square feet

Enclosed parking most friendly (don’t have pets yet)
In unit washerdryer  
Secure entry
I work at the university of Houston college of medicine. 
Current 13 month lease ends around July? (I know im looking too early)",,,,,
Agent,,Audio Message,,,,
Lead,"Got your voice message. 

No, I don’t think I need to set a new place before the sixty day period. So no need to look now. I reached out because I saw a video in insta about a place and was just curious about it. Just keeping a running list of places so that when the time comes I can jump on it. I have some domestic and international travel in the spring/summer so I’m taking this early period to research areas, as I’m not originally from this area ",,,,,
Agent,,Audio Message,,,,
Agent,"Hey LaShaune, we’re somewhere around 60-90 days from your lease ending so we can kind of dial in some of your best options. Is everything the same since we last spoke? 

2 bed 2 bath, under $2500, inner loop (heights, River oaks, etc), over 1,000sqft sound about right?",,,,,
Lead,Yes,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll send you some options in a bit and we can start coordinating tours. Do you know when in July your lease ends?",,,,,
Lead,Hello I misspoke-I signed a 13 month lease to get the discount . It started in July 2024 so I think that means I’d be moving in August. Sorry about that ,,,,,
Agent,No worries! That sounds good. I’ll send you some options but we’ll come back around about early June to really get started ,,,,,
Agent,"Just emailed your list
 
Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

I’m able to do that when I’m listed as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you",,,,,
Lead,I’m working but I’ll circle back! Thanks ,,,,,
Agent,"No worries! Sounds perfect, happy to help",,,,,
Agent,"Hey LaShaune, when in August does your lease end? I want to make sure if anything shows up early that I can send it over ",,,,,
Lead,Hi there I’m Ireland right now but my lease ends at the last week of July? ,,,,,
Lead,So yes it’s time to finalize,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, let’s lock in some days to start touring when you’re back. When will be ideal for you to tour?",,,,,
Lead,I’ll be back in a week so after that ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, sounds good",,,,,
Lead,Back in the states! ,,,,,
Lead,What are the typical options for days/times for touring ,,,,,
Agent,"Perfect! Generally weekdays and Saturdays between 10-5, Sundays 1-5pm. What works best for you?",,,,,
Lead,"Weekends are usually good except for between June 6-12 when I am in Minneapolis.
Weekdays o can often do if I have notice.",,,,,
Agent,We can shoot for this weekend if that works for you?,,,,,
Lead,Sure ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll update your list tonight for you to choose from",,,,,
Lead,Great ,,,,,
Agent,Good morning LaShaune☀️ I went and added some options to your list. I saw you already started favoriting which is great. Narrow down all that you want to see and let me know when you’re done 👍🏼,,,,,
Lead,"Hi there: 
Could I see:
Alexan junction heights
Flats at west Alabama 
Pearl greenway
Bowen River oaks? 
Pearl midlane River oaks?",,,,,
Agent,"Sure thing, I’ll schedule for Saturday. Can I make a few suggestions, no pressure? Take a second look at Artistry Design district and East Bend to see if you may want to tour. It’s my personal opinion also that Pearl Greenway is a lesser quality building than all others you chose. Just my input. Understand also if you’re trying to stay pretty strict to the River Oaks area",,,,,
Lead,"Artistry feels like it’s getting farther away from my office than I want during traffic. So maybe not that one?
Do you have others in River oaks/montrose with garages that you prefer that are roughly in the budget? ",,,,,
Lead,I might be open to east bend? ,,,,,
Lead,I think I’m just getting used to the area I’m in and am now starting to wonder if I want to completely leave ,,,,,
Lead,I’m willing to swap pearl greenway for something else ,,,,,
Lead,I didn’t see a galleria one that looked like it fit but maybe I missed it? Or montrose?  ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’m out now but I’ll run another search tonight. One that you can consider is Pearl marketplace at midtown. That will get you even closer to work.",,,,,
Lead,Hmmmm okay it looks like something was available now but I wasn’t sure if it has something later? ,,,,,
Lead,But looks nice I’d look ,,,,,
Lead,I’d be willing to tour ,,,,,
Agent,They had one available August 12. Not sure if that would be too late.,,,,,
Lead,It would make life kind of complicated. I need to be out of this place by the end of July?,,,,,
Lead,Not sure where I and my stuff would be in the interim ,,,,,
Agent,Okay. I’ll check again in a couple hours ,,,,,
Lead,"Real talk-I didn’t move in my current apartment until the 12th even though the lease started in the 1st.
I’m hoping to avoid paying for two places but I’d think it’s easier to get the keys early and start slowly moving the new place rather than live in an Airbnb or something ",,,,,
Lead,Cool ,,,,,
Lead,I’m also open to single family and townhouses if yiy ever see those ,,,,,
Agent,Okay 👌🏼 ,,,,,
Agent,"Just added a few more. These should be considered in my opinion…

- Alexan Junction Heights
$2620 + 2 months free | Aug 5

- Bowen River Oaks
$2380 | July 10

- Lenox Oaks
$2245 | July 27

- Flats at West Alabama
$2477 | July 28

- Heights at 1520
$2590 | July 19

- The Oliver
$2612 + 2 months free | July 15

- East Bend
$2380 | July 6

- Pearl Marketplace at Midtown 
$2254 | Aug 12

- The Briarly (galleria-brand new)
$2205 | lots of availability 


Most of these aren’t the only availability but seem to match best for price and move date + over 1,000 sqft. Again just my opinion but let me know what final options you’ll want to see",,,,,
Lead,Okay I’ll look ,,,,,
Lead,"Let’s view 
1. Flats at west Alabama 
2. Bowen  River oaks 
3. Oliver (although it’s greystsr and I’ve heard rumors about them)
4. Flats 1520
5. East bend",,,,,
Agent,"Sounds good, I’ll set them up. Greystar isn’t bad. They’re just so huge of a company some properties are poorly managed. Oliver isn’t one of them in my experience though ",,,,,
Agent,"Good morning LaShaune, right now Bowen, Alexan junction, and The Oliver are fully booked this weekend. Does any day during the week work before the 6th of June?",,,,,
Lead,Possibly? What days are you thinking ,,,,,
Agent,Maybe next week Tuesday and Wednesday. 2 tours one day and 3 another?,,,,,
Lead,Let me look. I’m in a work meeting right now ,,,,,
Lead,I see I’m doing to east bend and flats at west Alabama tomorrow,,,,,
Agent,"I scheduled because it was all they had but the times are really spread apart at 10:30am and 3pm so pretty inconvenient. We can keep them and just do the other 3 during the week or have all 5 for during the week, up to you",,,,,
Lead,I want to keep the flats for sure. It’s like two miles from my house so why not just go?,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, no problem. Let me know how you’d like to go about the others ",,,,,
Lead,"Quick question-are you needing to accompany me in the tours? If so, and the afternoon one is inconvenient for you then cancel. But I really thought the flats looked super cute so I’d like to see it. I’ve driven by it a lot",,,,,
Lead,Then I can see what slots I have for the week ,,,,,
Agent,The only tours I’m required to accompany you on are East Bend and Flats at West Alabama. I can make both appointments tomorrow no problem,,,,,
Agent,If the long break in between is okay with you we’ll see them both tomorrow and schedule the other 3 during the week?,,,,,
Lead,Okay cool let’s do that ,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good. Let me know when you know when is good for the other 3 so I can schedule well in advance,,,,,
Lead,How do the afternoons of June 3 (say after 230?) and June 4 work?,,,,,
Agent,"Those work. Do you want to spread them into two days or do a 3,4, & 5pm one day?",,,,,
Lead,Let’s do two days ,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Good morning LaShaune, running a couple minutes late. I should be there at 10:35.",,,,,
Lead,Okay ,,,,,
Lead,I’m here in the building. She’s letting me do the self guided tour so I guess I’ll go up? ,,,,,
Lead,,Image,,,,
Agent,"Okay, i’ll be there in 10 minutes. You can go up and we talk about it after or wait totally up to you.",,,,,
Lead,Okay I’m looking at thr amenities right now! I like taking my time so I’ll just start looking ,,,,,
Lead,Thanks,,,,,
Agent,Okay! I’m walking in now I can meet you on the third floor,,,,,
Lead,I’m in 310 ,,,,,
Agent,"Hey LaShaune, here’s your schedule for tomorrow and Wednesday. 

Tuesday, June 3 
3:30 PM – Alexis Junction Heights 
4 PM – the Oliver 

Wednesday, June 4 
3 PM – Bowen River Oak 
4 PM – Heights at 1520",,,,,
Agent,A couple more I think could be worth a look are  Lenox Heights and Modera Waugh. Let me know if you’d like to see either of these!,,,,,
Lead,Oh shoot! I scheduled a call for Wednesday at 4!,,,,,
Lead,Do they have any openings like today around 4?,,,,,
Lead,I’m sorry about that ,,,,,
Lead,It I could do Tuesday like around 2?,,,,,
Agent,No worries! They have today at 4 and Tuesday at 2. Which works best?,,,,,
Lead,Let’s knock it out today!,,,,,
Lead,Let me take a look at the other two online I feel like i remember them but I’ll look before you schedule ,,,,,
Agent,Scheduled Heights 1520 for today at 4pm,,,,,
Lead,Cool I’ll be there!,,,,,
Agent,I won’t be able to make it but just call or text if you have any questions!,,,,,
Lead,Okay no worries ,,,,,
Lead,"Modera Waugh looks good but is it in my price range? Maybe I’ll hold off on that one until after my work trip? 
My Internet at work is going in and out both Lenox heights also looks good but I’m not sure I can get to it this week-I’m catching up with meetings and doing early meetings since I’ll be out several days? ",,,,,
Lead,Maybe those two are back ups if I need them for next week?,,,,,
Agent,Modera Waugh has one unit within price range. It’s a 2/2 for $2475.,,,,,
Agent,"We can hold off for sure, just be aware that for the few that that have limited options in price range. Probability that those lease soon are high",,,,,
Lead,Heading to a meeting but maybe I can squeeze a few in ,,,,,
Lead,"Or, do you still get thr commission if I do a virtual visit? ",,,,,
Agent,Virtual will be fine. I will still schedule it for you. Just let me know which you might want to see virtually,,,,,
Lead,Heights 1520 went really well he showed me some units not on the web. It’s so new and pretty. It’s across from broad stone Oliver I noticed ,,,,,
Lead,I know I’m not viewing broadsrone Oliver I Just meant there’s a lot there ,,,,,
Agent,"That’s great, I’m glad it went well!",,,,,
Agent,Yes Broadstone Oliver is new also. They were on your list but none of the units have balconies. I didn’t know if that was maybe a reason you didn’t choose to see them. We can always add if you want though ,,,,,
Lead,"I’m going to see what tomorrow’s units look like before I start adding more. Don’t want to get overwhelmed. I’m not gonna lie, that b5 floor plan I saw today might have sold me on moving to the heights! 😜",,,,,
Lead,It was huge and really homey ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay! That’s great! That’s saying alot, to get you out of River Oaks. We have real contenders! 👌🏼",,,,,
Lead,"Am having a bit of a come to Jesus moment-for the finishes and sizes that I like, I’ll have to be more in the ~2700 range.

Oliver wasn’t bad, but doesn’t seem to have as many community spaces as yesterday’s apartment and alexan junction.

There’s a b5 at alexan junction heights, the bigger one: it’s really homey, not its not open until the first week of August. I’d either have to see if I can stay on my current place a little bit longer or store my stuff for a couple of weeks.",,,,,
Lead,"Right now 1520 and Alexan are the front runners, in my mind ",,,,,
Agent,Sounds good! Staying at your current place a little while longer shouldn’t be a problem. You would just need to let your apartment know soon before somebody leases your apartment and expects to move in when you leave.,,,,,
Lead,"Bowen was nice but the vibes of the residents was very “Houston aspirational” people wearing logos/labels. I’m too crunchy granola for that building! lol 

Anyway, I decided-I’m going to apply for the 1520 building. 
I had looked at some condos and houses on my own this past two weeks and I don’t want deal with that landlord drama. 

So gonna just go with the apartment. 

Will keep you posted.",,,,,
Agent,"Lol understood! And sounds perfect, please keep me posted and let me know if I can help with anything",,,,,
Agent,Also please be on the lookout for the referral section of the applications. That’s how the apartment takes care of me as your locator 😌,,,,,
Lead,Weird question-my bephew lives in McKinney and he needs to find a place and might also benefit from working Witt a concierge-do you work in the Dallas area? ,,,,,
Lead,Also by the way my application was accepted at 1520. ,,,,,
Lead,They’ve already assigned me to a move in concierge ,,,,,
Lead,Haven’t seen the lease yet? So haven’t been able to mention you yet ,,,,,
Agent,Sure I can definitely help him out. ,,,,,
Agent,"That’s amazing, congratulations!! I’m glad we found the one. And no worries",,,,,
Agent,Hopefully they send the lease over before the weekend. Let me know if they don’t!,,,,,
Lead,Will do ,,,,,
Lead,Yeah they called me last night to let me know ,,,,,
Lead,So it’s only been like a day-I had drama because my paystubs were oawsseird protected and they couldn’t open them? But then they complained when I printed and scanned them in because they were not original? ,,,,,
Lead,🙄,,,,,
Lead,But we sorted it out ,,,,,
Agent,Okay. Yea they are very particular when it comes to paystubs lol. It helps keep you from living next to any crazies. I’m glad y’all got it sorted out 🙌🏼,,,,,
Agent,"Hey LaShaune, I wanted to make sure you’re all set with 1520. Have you already signed your lease?",,,,,
Lead,"No not yet. I messaged them over the weekend. And they said Jesse the leasing guy would call me early in the week?
No word yet. ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, just got off the phone with them. They said they’d send it over “asap”",,,,,
Lead,Cool thanks! ,,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey LaShaune, making sure you’re all good. Have you signed your lease and all set with a move in date?",,,,,
Lead,I did sign my lease-essentially within a few days of that last text ,,,,,
Lead,Moving in August 1,,,,,
Agent,Amazing! I’m really happy we found the right place. Do you have any questions right now for me or for them leading up to move in day?,,,,,
Lead,"Yes, it's been a really long journey and I appreciate all of your patience through this process. I do have a mover booked I believe and they have a concierge person who called me and helped me with getting an electric company and I have to also now sign up for the gas company that they suggested so that seems to be going OK they have AT&T in the building for like cable and stuff so that'll be fine so I think it'll be OK so far. I'm moving in on August 1 moving out of my building on the 31st.",,,,,
Agent,"Most definitely. And it’s really been a pleasure to help. Thank you for being so communicative throughout, that really does make it easier on me to help the best way possible. That sounds good, if any questions or issues arise please let me know and of course I’ll do what I can. And I’ll stay in touch. If you need anything, or if you have friends/family/coworkers that could use my help, please send them over, I love helping associates and loved ones!",,,,,
Agent,"Also, a couple details when you get a chance. Can you send over please 🙏🏼…

Unit #
Base rent
Any specials 
Lease term",,,,,
Lead,I'm driving but yes later today I can send that over to you. Thank you.,,,,,
Agent,Thanks a bunch,,,,,
Lead,"Hi there! Yesterday was full of meetings…

I signed a 12 month lease. 
I’m moving August 1 into unit 1488.

Monthly base rent is $2760.",,,,,
Lead,,Image,,,,
Lead,"This is a screen shot from my lease. 

I get the 8 weeks free concession.

And I got the look and lease thing as well which meant my application fee and admin fees were discounted. ",,,,,
Lead,Also my nephew seems to have found a place in McKinney Texas. But my brother was wondering if there were any discounts on movers/moving supplies out there? ,,,,,
Agent,Thanks a bunch! ,,,,,
Agent,"And for your nephew, has he already applied?",,,,,
Lead,I think so? You know these kids! ,,,,,
Lead,lol ,,,,,
Agent,Lol if it was before the application and we were listed my company could have gotten him $200 off his movers. Nothing we can do now though I’m afraid 🫤,,,,,
Lead,Oh nooo I don’t think he’s scheduled the movers I thought you meant apartments ,,,,,
Agent,"Right, if he listed us as his referral when applying to his apartment we could have gotten him $200 off movers because we’d be getting paid for the transaction. But since he already applied to his apartment, there’s nothing my company can do to get him that $200 off movers",,,,,
Lead,Oh I see ,,,,,
Lead,Thabks for clearing that up! ,,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Lead,If something changes I’ll let you know ,,,,,
Agent,Okay sounds good. I’ll be here for you to reach out to throughout your lease also so if there’s ever something I can help with never hesitate to let me know ,,,,,
Lead,"Okay, so maybe I do need help-I booked all my sons movers with a discount through someone wise but I’m seeing some videos saying they’re awful. 
Do you have other Houston area suggestions? ",,,,,
Agent,,Image,,,,
Agent,"Sure, these are a recommendation from my team. Can you please share your nephews name here and have him let Graham know Brie sent him?",,,,,
Lead,"Wait is this a Houston area mover for me?

Or for my nephew in McKinney, Judy making sure I understand your text. 

I’m the one who needs the mover ",,,,,
Agent,Those are Houston movers 👌🏼,,,,,
Agent,Hey! Sorry I’m just noticing the confusion in my message lol. Movers are for Houston (I misread ”all my sons”) you’re good to reach out to Graham and tell them Brie sent you!,,,,,
Lead,He’s really nice! I talked to him today.,,,,,
Agent,Perfect! I’m glad y’all spoke. I’m still here if you need anything else!,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Maronda, it’s Ashanti from IG. Just so I send options for the right move dates, is 5/3/2025 when your lease at The Flats ends?",,,,,
Lead,Yes that is correct ,,,,,
Lead,Hello Ashanti thank you for reaching out ,,,,,
Agent,Okay perfect. Absolutely! I have the main details from your IG message but let me know any other details you’d like me to know when searching. What email should I send apartments to?,,,,,
Lead,"mmchenault@gmail.com
Thank you",,,,,
Agent,,Audio Message,,,,
Lead,"Good morning Yes I am open to any surrounding areas. Plano, frisco or anywhere that is nice and the area is quiet. I am 52 so I am not sure if i qualify for any “senior” communities (omg I’m a senior 😜) 
Thank you again for your help! ",,,,,
Agent,Got it! And not quite! Those senior communities usually start at 55+. Pleasure is all mine 😌,,,,,
Lead,Ok great! I am not from Dallas even through I’ve been here for 5 years I live stayed in my bubble so any suggestions would be welcomed ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay got it, I’ll send some options in a bit!",,,,,
Agent,"Just emailed your list!
 
Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 

I’m able to do that when I’m listed as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you",,,,,
Lead,"Ok awesome thank you so much! I will make sure I let you know what I decide. 
I will have time later today to look and follow up tomorrow or this evening",,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is mine! That sounds perfect ,,,,,
Lead,Hello I also wanted to mention that I want a unit on the top floor street facing not looking into the courtyard ,,,,,
Lead,Also with washer and dryer in the unit ,,,,,
Agent,Noted. All I sent will definitely have washer and dryer in the unit. I’ll dig to make sure we get top floor as well. Whenever you have your favorites I’ll revisit so I have a basis to work off of ,,,,,
Lead,I responded to your email with my favorites ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay perfect, I see them now. I’ll take a look tonight and we can start scheduling tours for this weekend. Are you pretty free Saturday & Sunday?",,,,,

Lead,Sounds good ,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, I saw some apartments that were like two doors down from the 190 that had like a water or a lake behind it. What are the names of those and what are the prices? I only saw it as I was driving off that’s why I didn’t go by there no rush thank you so much.",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Maronda, it’s either Adaline at the Station or Linz at the Station you’re talking about. Let me know if you’d like to schedule a tour and I’ll get you scheduled 👍🏼

Lead,"Good morning Ashanti
thank you 💛
I sent you an email. I believe that MilesOne90 may have a top level that she did not mention I am not sure what “HC” meant in the floor plan ",,,,,
Lead,,Image,,,,
Agent,"Okay great, that one looks like it may work. HC usually stands for High Ceilings so it could be a steal. ",,,,,
Agent,"We could wait until tomorrow to confirm or apply to avoid anyone else applying, since it’s the only top floor B2 in the price range",,,,,
Lead,Ok thank you for clarifying ,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure’s all mine ,,,,,
Lead,What do you suggest? If it is not available I loose the application fee correct? ,,,,,
Agent,"I suggest we wait and ask. The HC could also stand for Handicap accessible which would mean lower counter tops, bars in the shower, etc",,,,,
Lead,Ok makes since ,,,,,
Agent,*Loved Message,,,,,

Agent,"Hey Maronda, I’m still looking for other options. I updated your portal with a few more. Are you open to Garland? The Quinn on Thirty has some spacious top floor options and they’re less than 20 mins from Downtown",,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti 
No I am not interested in that area of Dallas. No Garland , Mesquite or downtown. I do not want to move in that direction if at all possible. 
Thank you",,,,,
Agent,Okay got it,,,,,

Lead,Or what is the move in date? ,,,,,
Lead,I called and spoke with the leasing agent so no worries ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I was wrong on price. Just incase you got different info from leasing best options would probably be..

B2 - $1987 - May 12
B1 - $1918 - Now (can be held for 2 weeks and can see if leasing will accommodate early May move)",,,,,
Lead,Hello Ashanti so let me find out if they will allow me to extend my lease if not I will let you know. I don’t have family here so we don’t have anyone to stay with or a place to put our belongings if we have to extend for a week or a few days ,,,,,

Agent,And yes we’re actually partnered with this moving company and you’ll get two free hours with them through us. If you’d like them to reach out to you to discuss your move just let me know and I’ll arrange it!,,,,,
Agent,,Electronic Business card,,,,
Lead,"Yes please set up a call 
The Move date is May 2 
From 75080 to 75040",,,,,
Agent,Okay will do! ,,,,,
Lead,Do you know if they are bonded and insured?,,,,,
Agent,"I can only assume since they are partnered with my company. You can ask when they call and I know many agents who use them all the time in Dallas, I’m just not one of them. And of course there’s no obligation when you speak to them, just let me know once you do if you’ll be going with them",,,,,
Lead,Thank you will do,,,,,
Agent,Absolutely!,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti I’m going to go with the moving company you suggested.
I know you say they are good and his quote seems reasonable. Do you need contact them before I send the deposit? ",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Maronda! Okay perfect. No, you’re good to go. They already know you’re a referral from us and the two free hours will reflect in your bill. 

When you get a chance I’ll just need your lease info below please!

Lease term
Base rent amount 
Any specials received 
Unit number ",,,,,
Lead,I sent you an email with the information you requested 💛,,,,,
Agent,*Loved message,,,,,
Agent,Thank you! 😊 ,,,,,
Lead,You’re welcome ,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Maronda, I just wanted to make sure move in went smooth. How has your move in and apartment experience been so far?",,,,,

,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Lauren, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form! I’m happy to help you find your next apartment and share any post info from my Instagram page. 
 
What areas/neighborhoods are you considering? ",,,,,
Lead,Hey Ashanti ! Thank you for reaching out. I’m looking to move    to heights / midtown area  . I do see East downtown has some new things I’m willing to explore.  ,,,,,
Agent,Of course! Got it! When are you needing to move? Do you have a specific lease end date?,,,,,
Lead,I would like to move by May .,,,,,
Lead,No lease end date ,,,,,
Lead, Med Center is also an option ,,,,,
Agent,,Audio Message,,,,
Lead,Good morning! Honestly 1700ish probably would be max for me.  My work schedule is flexibility . I only work 3 days. Weekdays are best for me . ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay got it! Are there any other details that are important to you that I should know? Pet friendly, square foot requirements, special amenities, etc?",,,,,
Lead,I would prefer like a 700sq foot. Nothing too big since it’s just me . I am a sucker for nice amenities. I do like the new modern look . ,,,,,
Lead,Idk if I mentioned washer/ dryer ,,,,,
Agent,Got it. And yes of course washer and dryer will be included. I’ll send some options shortly and we’ll start scheduling some tours!,,,,,
Agent,"Just emailed your list!
 
Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

Keep in mind most options I sent are running specials (Ex. 6 weeks free) which can significantly reduce the base rent amount you see

Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 

I’m able to do that when I’m listed as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Lead,Thank you! I’ll check it out ,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is mine! Sounds perfect ,,,,,
Lead,"Here are my top pick . 
Freeway Place 
Tempo at white oak 
Lenox heights
Rye heights
The miller residences
Artistry design",,,,,
Agent,Okay perfect. Drewery Place for the first one? Does Monday/Tuesday tours sound good? It might be a tight window to try to schedule them for tomorrow and Friday,,,,,
Lead,"Yes Drewery place . Sorry 😭
Monday works for me .",,,,,
Agent,Lol no worries. Okay sounds good. I’ll have them all scheduled for Monday! 👍🏼,,,,,
Lead,Sounds good . Just keep me posted . Any deals at 10x15  street flats? ,,,,,
Agent,"Will do, I’ll send you the full schedule when they’re confirmed. And they’re giving a $500 credit. They generally never have specials more than that",,,,,
Lead,"Compared to the others, that’s not a good deal ? ",,,,,
Agent,No. Many I sent are offering a month to two months free. Which is a $1700-$3400 credit,,,,,
Lead,Another thing.. sorry . Safety is a big one too for me . ,,,,,
Agent,No worries! I hear you,,,,,
Agent,"Good evening Lauren. Here’s the schedule for Monday!

10 AM – Artistry design district 
11 AM – Rye Heights 
12 PM – Lenox Heights 
1 PM – Tempo at White Oak 
2 PM – The Mill residences",,,,,
Agent,The only building that was completely booked is Drewery Place who stays pretty booked. The next available tours are Thursday morning and then next Monday. Let me know which will work best!,,,,,
Lead,Ahh sadness. That’s the one I was looking forward to . Let’s do the 10th at 11am,,,,,
Agent,"I’m sorry. On the 10th they have 9:30, 12:30, 1:30, 2:30. Which would be best?",,,,,
Lead,Good morning! Let’s do 9:30am,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning! You’re booked for Drewery Place on Monday, march 10 @9:30am 👍🏼",,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,Absolutely!,,,,,
Agent,Good morning Lauren!☀️ Good luck touring today. I won’t be there with you but I’m just a call/text/voice message away! I’m excited to hear how everything goes!,,,,,
Lead, Good morning! Thank you! I’ll keep you posted ! ☺️,,,,,
Agent,*Loved Message,,,,,
Agent,Sounds perfect!!,,,,,
Lead,Can you talk rn ? ,,,,,Escalate to a human
Agent,Yes!,,,,,
Lead,,Image,,,,
Lead,Heyy Ashanti ! Let’s schedule to talk tomorrow? I’m free all day. What time works for you?,,,,,
Lead,"I actually looked here since I was on this side of town. The prices are *chefs kiss * like $1100-$1300.  The location is not ideal but those prices make it worth it . However, the only thing missing is a balcony 😭 think you could find something like this in the same are with a balcony? ",,,,,
Lead,bellrockmemorial.com,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Lauren! Okay, morning works like 9am and then 1pm and then the evening will work at like 7pm. 

Okay, the properties that will be similar are Broadstone properties that won’t have balconies either, so Broadstone Amarra and Broadstone Amelia. And then Co-op Heights has balconies but doesn’t have amenities lol so no pool or gym. 

One that I think will be right in the middle of lower end and what you saw today would be The Briarly. Brand new in the Galleria with one bedrooms at $1513 and they’re running a month free. 

Thebriarly.com",,,,,
Lead,Let’s talk tomorrow at 9am .,,,,,Escalate to a human
Agent,"Perfect. Just give me a call, I may be driving",,,,,
Lead,"Okay sounds good.
 I’m just a girl who wants her cake and eat it too . 🥴  So, sorry in advance for my difficulties.",,,,,
Lead,Good morning! are you free?,,,,,Escalate to a human
Agent,Good morning! Yes!,,,,,
Agent,Couple others that could be worth seeing is Filament at the Grid and Lenox at the grid. Built in 2023 & 2024 and units start in the $1400’s. They’re slightly closer than Sugarland but on the same side of town you’re on now,,,,,
Lead, I’ll look into them ,,,,,
Agent,Hey Lauren! What are your thoughts on Filament and Lenox at the grid? Trying to coordinate your tours today because some have limited availability,,,,,
Lead,Heyyy Ashanti ! I like them but too close to where I am now. Feel like I should just stay home. I prefer to be closer to the city .,,,,,
Agent,Got it! No problem ,,,,,
Lead,For vibe .. is it at 1pm ?,,,,,
Lead,Can we move it to 12? I work night shift Monday and need to be home by like 1pm ? So I can nap before work.,,,,,
Agent,"Sorry Lauren, I never sent my message! For Vibe it’s at 1:30pm that’s the earliest they had besides a 9am but that would conflict with your 9:30am appt at Drewery Place. Do you want to move it to another day?",,,,,
Lead,Hey Ashanti ! No worries ! Yes . Let’s book another day . I can do the 17th or 18th . What’s all scheduled for Monday?,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll schedule for the morning of the 17th. Monday you have Drewery Place at 9:30am and The Briarly at 11am.",,,,,
Lead,Let’s go for  the 17th around like 11/12,,,,,
Lead,Have you seen any other spots that you think I may like? ,,,,,
Agent,Vibe is going to be that low price you reallly want. Thats just not common in the areas we want and like you seen might have to sacrifice balcony etc. The other options will be more in that 1600 range we already saw. I’m personally hoping you fall in love with The Briarly. $1513 isn’t as low as $1300 but still saves you a bit more than those $1600 range units and to get everything you want would be a win. Once you see those if you still aren’t sold we can go back to square one. That sound good?,,,,,
Lead,Good idea. ,,,,,
Agent,*Loved Message,,,,,
Lead,Hey Ashanti!  Can you please cancel the Vibe reservation for tomorrow. Thank you.,,,,,
Agent,Done! Just sent them an email 👍🏼,,,,,
Agent,"For Drewery Place they require you to list the locator when you tour, just a heads up. Here’s any info you’ll need below. I’m excited to hear how everything goes tomorrow!

Ashanti DePass - AptAmigo",,,,,
Lead,Thank you!😌,,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Agent,,Audio Message,,,,
Lead,Good morning! Hoping for some good results 🤞🏼,,,,,
Agent,Same! 🤞🏼,,,,,
Agent,"Just checked prices and Drewery is $1602 for their 640 sqft S1.2. It’s more like a studioish layout with a separate bedroom. 

The Briarly increased by about $50 also 😕 their A0 would work best starting at $1565. 

Heads up so you’re prepared!",,,,,
Lead,Heyy Ashanti ! Finished with touring for the day . I really like Briarly . I saw A0 and A1. I personally like A1 bc it has that guest connection to the restroom. But ofc it’s $1715. A0 would work thought . Just have to compromise.,,,,,
Agent,"Nicee! Okay, it looks like they have other options even slightly bigger than the A1 for $1645 with guest connection to the restroom. Did you care to see those or is the A0 price point the difference maker?",,,,,
Lead,She didn’t mentioned that one to me 😭,,,,,
Lead,I’ll have to pass back by to see that one .,,,,,
Agent,🤦🏽‍♂️. Lol okay. Don’t wait long! They’ve already started raising their prices which this early on can mean people are leasing like crazy so the owners think they’re leaving money on the table by pricing too low,,,,,
Lead,😭😭,,,,,
Lead,That’s the part . I never know what I want . ,,,,,
Lead,Depending how I feel when I get off tomorrow.. I might pass back by .,,,,,
Agent,When in doubt it’s harder to go wrong with Brand New. Prices can change everyday so if you need help with the decision making we can talk about everything. I just don’t want you to miss out on current pricing if they were to go up!,,,,,
Lead,"Going for a nap now . I’m thinking. I’m just a girl who doesn’t know what she wants 🥹 I’ll keep you posted .

Also, brairly offers $750 for healthcare workers 🥳",,,,,
Agent,"Lol okay, I’ll be staying on top of you for us to get it figured out. 

Perfect!! Everything helps 🙌🏼",,,,,

Lead,Thank you! It’s looking like the brairly but imma just pray about it .,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is all mine! Okay sounds like a good idea 👌🏼,,,,,
Agent,,Video,,,,
Agent,A3 at Briarly - $1645,,,,,
Lead,Ahhh the best ! 😌,,,,,
Lead,I’m just comparing everything. I should have an answer soon 🤞🏼,,,,,
Agent,Okay! 👌🏼,,,,,
Lead,Heyyy Ashanti! I hope you are had a great day. The mill called me today and said they can offer me the 6wk free if I sign by the weekend. $1580 base + amenities total $1664. I think this is a steal !,,,,,
Agent,Mmmmm I say go for it!,,,,,
Agent,Morning Lauren ☀️ I’m here if you’re still torn and need help deciding!,,,,,
Lead,Good afternoon! 😌Thank you! I plan to sign at the Mill today. Imma go check it out one more time.,,,,,
Agent,"Sounds perfect! I’ll be here! If you go and apply, please be on the look out for the locator referral section on the app 🙏🏼 ",,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Lead,Hey ! Sorry for texting so late . I’m doing the app but there isn’t a spot to put your name . Just “ apartment locator “,,,,,
Agent,No worries! Yes just choose “apartment locator”. That will work. Thanks!,,,,,
Lead,Hey Ashanti ! Question : the mill requires rental verification… I still live at home . How would that work ? ,,,,,
Lead,I rented when I was in college that’s all . ,,,,,
Lead,I also have a mortgage .. would that work ? ,,,,,
Agent,Mmm if they’re asking for a current address is one thing but if they want to know where you rented and the only place is where you rented in college they would want to know where. I’d ask the leasing agent who is over your file if you’ve been in direct contact with anyone specifically ,,,,,
Lead,Heyy Ashanti ! I hope you are having a good day! Just wanted to updated you that I got approved. They will be send the contract soon 🥳,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Lauren!! Thats amazing!!! Exciting stuff you’re one step closer! 🥳🥳. And perfect, when you have the info handy can you please send over these details…

- Move date
- Base rent
- Any specials received
- unit number
- Lease term",,,,,
Lead,Loved Message,,,,,
Lead,"Heyy Ashanti . Happy Sunday✨
Here are the details:
- Move date: 5/16
- Base rent:$1853
- Any specials received: 6 weeks free ( $1664 )
- unit number: 306
- Lease term: 13 months",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Lauren! Sorry, today was a heavy travel day. Thank you for the info! 

For your $200 rebate, you’ll be paid via Zelle using the number we have on file. You’ll be paid when the property pays and the same day as me. That’s generally 60-90 days from move-in so usually a nice surprise. I’ll still be here to help anyway I can so if you have any questions or concerns never hesitate to reach out!",,,,,

Agent,"Hey Dominik, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form! I’m happy to help you find your next apartment and share any post info from my Instagram page. 
 
What areas/neighborhoods are you considering?",,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti. 
I’m looking at sugarland thus far, the company I’m transferring to is located at 
12941 Cullen Blvd
Houston, TX  77047
United States
My only requirements are:
Garage , dog friendly (I have an ESA that’s a pitbull but I rather just deal w it) , hoping for under 30 minute commute to work, preferably in an area with a younger crowd. 

Hope that helps man",,,,,
Agent,Got it! Thanks for the info. How soon are you looking to move in? Are you moving from another city or already in Houston or surrounding areas?,,,,,
Lead,"I’m trying to be in Houston by the 5th or March roughly. I should be starting worn the 10th of March 

I’m currently living in Nashville though so I am not there",,,,,
Agent,"Okay got it, so sounds like you’ll be deciding using virtual tours only. Is $1500 flexible at all or do you want that to be absolute max?",,,,,
Lead,"1500 is the preferable max, it can be pushed depending on location and amenities though. ",,,,,
Agent,"Got it, I’ll send you some options shortly and we’ll start getting some virtual tours scheduled",,,,,
Lead,"Awesome, thanks man!",,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is mine!,,,,,
Agent,"Just emailed your list
 
Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

Let me know the top 3-5 you want to virtually tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 

I’m able to do that when I’m listed as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Lead,What do you mean by a free move? I’m not tracking ,,,,,
Agent,"The free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate because the move never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay a move deposit and you just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out.",,,,,
Lead,"Understood, I’d most likely go with that. 
If you don’t mind me asking, what do you ask for the finders fee or your “cut” per se?",,,,,
Agent,Okay. Nothing at all. I work with the buildings in the city and get paid from the building you choose out of their marketing budget. It’s free for you. ,,,,,
Lead,"Oh awesome, I’m up in NYC visiting fam today so give me till mid day tomorrow and I’ll send you pack my top 3 if that works with you",,,,,
Agent,That works perfectly! Talk to you tomorrow,,,,,
Lead,"Hey man!
So I narrowed it down to 4, I don’t know if you can see my favorited apartments on the account created so if you need me to list them off let me know!",,,,,
Agent,Got you! Yes I can see them. I’ll start getting virtual tours together this week!,,,,,
Lead,"Awesome! 
Also, just to clarify. They do all have garages correct? I’ll be needing it for storage & parking my personal & company vehicle that’s why I ask. ",,,,,
Agent,"Filament at the Grid and Lenox at the grid have private garages. You don’t normally see private garages at apartments in the inner city so Lenox Oaks doesn’t, but they have a private multi-level parking garage and you can rent a designated space. Plus they have storage units on site. 1879 is the only property without either. They were built in 2019 compared to 2023 and newer for the other three options anyway so I think you’d probably prefer them least. ",,,,,
Lead,Okay so let’s just focus on Filament and Lenox then! That makes this easier ,,,,,
Agent,Okay sounds good! I’ll follow up in the next couple days,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning Dominik. For Filament and Lenox they both have virtual tours on their website and the 1 bedrooms shown would be the exact one bed rooms we’d be looking at in your price range. 

On the Home Screen click “Virtual Tours” and look at the A1/1bed. There is also virtual tours of all amenities ",,,,,

Agent,lenoxatthegrid.com,,,,,
Agent,,Audio Message,,,,
Lead,"Good morning Ashanti! 
Filament seems as if they have slightly larger sq.ft so that’s something to consider. Honestly, the dealbreaker at this point is the garages with pricing. Let me know and we’ll work further! Thank you ",,,,,
Agent,"Okay! I just spoke to them both and Filaments 1 car garages are $175 per month. 2 car garages are $250. 
Lenox said they don’t offer private garages anymore. I’m not sure if they turned them into storage or what but no garage options there",,,,,
Lead,"Sounds good! Filament is the one then. 
Do you possibly have a layout of the garage there? Just wanted to see the size ",,,,,
Agent,Sounds perfect! Let me see if the office can send some video/pictures ,,,,,
Agent,Only one leasing agent in the office today. When he gets a chance he’s going to get some pics for us. I’ll send them over when he sends them,,,,,
Lead,Sounds good ,,,,,
Agent,,Video,,,,
Agent,,Video,,,,
Agent,"Here you go Dominik, let me know your thoughts ",,,,,
Lead,Is that a parking spot outside of it as well? ,,,,,
Agent,Yes there’s a space to park outside of the garage as well. Essentially you could park 2 cars ,,,,,
Lead,Perfect. Let’s do it ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay great, so now we need to figure out what unit you want to apply to. Some units are on special for 4 weeks free and some aren’t. So we want to figure out that and maybe coordinate a unit that is closer to an available garage. Let me see what details I can get before they close in a few minutes",,,,,
Agent,Do you have a floorplan preferences from the website?,,,,,
Lead,"Their A2.0 would probably be preferred, I’m open to seeing what’s available closest to the garage though ",,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, sorry to text you late/on a Saturday. Can we possibly move the date up on me having the apartment signed for to sometime next week with the tentative move in date by the 3rd of March? Let me know if that works.",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Dominik, it’s no bother. I didn’t even realize you texted back yesterday so that’s my bad. But yes that’s no problem. They open tomorrow at 12pm CST. I’ll call to get our A2.0 options and see which are closest to an available garage. We’ll push to have all the info we need and apply tomorrow.",,,,,
Lead,No worries! Like I said I’m open to others if there’s a better location to the garage or whatever it may be. Can you also see if they wave any fees or reduce rent for veterans? Completely forgot to even ask that ,,,,,
Agent,Got it! And I’ll check on that for you. I’ll follow up tomorrow once I talk to them,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Dominik, here’s the info you’ll need! Let me know if you have any questions and which unit you’ll be applying to 👍🏼",,,,,
Agent,"*First number of 4-digits is the building number (Ex. 1234 would be building 1)

*Second number of 4-digits is the floor number (Ex. 1234 would be 2nd floor)

*Building 1 is the only building with elevators & has No available garages

*Buildings 2,3,4,5 Do not have elevators but they all have available garages

A2 - Would be more your standard unit with equal space around 

A4 (Any units starting with A4) - You get a built-in desk & double sink vanity. Lose a little space in living room 


A2.0 - 732 sqft 
#3304 - $1435 
#3306 - $1435
#2112 - $1450 


A4.50 - 739 sqft 
#4204 - $1445 
#4304 - $1445
#5204 - $1445
#5212 - $1445
#5304 - $1445


A4.4 - 752 sqft 
#3308 - $1475
#2308 - $1475


A4.2 ANSI - 754 sqft 
#1215 - $1475 

All of these units under $1500 are already reduced price so you won’t get any weeks free. But if you select a move in for this month February 28 you will receive $500 credit to use toward March. 

Veteran discount - They could possibly credit you back your application & Admin Fee but leasing agent (Heidi) would need to wait until management is back in the office tomorrow to ask.",,,,,
Lead,"Awesome, I’ll look into it here in a bit since I’m currently out at lunch. 
Question for you, I didn’t realize Stafford has such a “bad” reputation. Do you agree with it or is it an area that’s growing? I don’t want to move somewhere where I have to look over my shoulder 24/7 if that makes any sense.",,,,,
Agent,Sounds perfect. I haven’t been told of a bad reputation for Stafford. Here is a crime map for 2025 of the full city. ,,,,,
Agent,https://communitycrimemap.com/,,,,,
Lead,Okay I looked I’m still good with Filament. I was looking at the apartment layouts and is there any way you can ask the team there to check with which apartment would have the best view of the garage available by chance? That way I can see everything. Or is that not an option? ,,,,,
Lead,Sorry about having you ask them a million things 😂 moving blindly isn’t ideal ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay. No unfortunately there’s really no way to see the garage from your unit. The garages would enter the first floor of your building and the buildings are spaced out and aside of each other, not across. 

I get it! I’ve never moved blindly but lots of my clients have and I get all kinds of questions to make sure they move in comfortably with all questions answered so I get it for sure.",,,,,
Lead,Alright no worries! Realistically 3304 and 3306 are my top two. ,,,,,
Agent,Okay! Do you want to get started on the application? I think you should try to set move in for Feb 28 instead of March 3 so you can get the $500 credit,,,,,
Lead,Yeah let’s go ahead and do that then ,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, it’s done right on the website. 3304 and 3306 are literally next door to each other so wouldn’t make the biggest difference. 

Please be on the lookout for the referral section of the app and choose [Apartment Locator & Ashanti DePass with AptAmigo] as your referral where applicable. 

Let me know if you have any questions and when you’ve submitted!",,,,,
Lead,"I’m filling it out currently, but I just saw that my dogs breed is on the restricted list. He’s considered an ESA, but I wasn’t sure if I should just delete his info then or what ",,,,,
Agent,"There should be an area to mention he’s an ESA so you’d be exempt from any breed restrictions, pet fees, etc. ",,,,,
Agent,If you don’t see it you can keep his info off to prevent any automatic denial and send it to the leasing agent who takes over your file after ,,,,,
Lead,"Ok, I didn’t see anything so I’ll leave it off for the time being ",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Dominik, all good for now?",,,,,
Lead,"Yessir, just waiting on my ESA letter to be approved so they can send me the lease info. I mentioned to them on the phone and through their paperwork you helped me with the process. 

They said this morning it’ll be approved today or tomorrow latest. We’ll see",,,,,
Agent,Sounds perfect 👌🏼 I’m around if you need. Let me know when they give you the final approval!,,,,,
Agent,"Morning Dominik! Can you send me these details from your lease when you get a chance so I can initiate your $200 rebate

- Move-in date
- Lease term
- Base rent
- Any specials received 
- unit #",,,,,
Lead,"28feb2025
13m/ march 27 2026 end

Am I including the garage or just the base?
$500 off first month

3306",,,,,
Agent,Thanks man! Just the base rent ,,,,,
Lead,,photo,,,,
Lead,I haven’t even got there yet 😂 I need to double check the $500 off cause this email confused me. But that’s everything I believe you need.,,,,,
Agent,"Lol you should get the $500 off but that would be shown in your lease. This email is showing what you pay at move in, which is your $500 deposit, 1 day for Feb 28th ($62.72), and the month of March",,,,,
Lead,Hey man! I never got that $200 rebate off you lol,,,,,
Agent,What’s up man! The rebate comes when Filament pays my company. That’ll be within 60 days of your move date so in the next couple weeks!,,,,,
Agent,Hey Dominik! Company was paid. Do you have Zelle?,,,,,
Lead,It shoukd be linked straight to my bank!,,,,,
Agent,There’s no name attached to Zelle so no way to confirm it’s linked. Do you have cashapp or Venmo?,,,,,

Agent,Sent!,,,,,
Lead,Thanks man!!!,,,,,
Agent,Absolutely! Thanks for working with me! If you ever need help in the future or have friends and family who would benefit from working with me please send them over!,,,,,

,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Briana, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form! I’m excited to help you find your next apartment and share any info from my Instagram page!
 
What areas/neighborhoods are you considering? ",,,,,
Lead,"Hi ashanti! I’m interested in Trinity Groves and bishop arts. Ultimately, I want to be as close as possible to downtown Dallas within a reasonable budget.",,,,,
Agent,,Voice Message,,,,
Lead,My budget is flexible. I guess my absolute cap will be around 1700-1800. My move date is May 1 but I am coming down to March 2-4th and that’s when I would like to sign a lease on a place.,,,,,
Agent,Okay got it. Can you share any other non-negotiables you have? Is it only that your apt must have a den/desk or work space?,,,,,
Lead,"Downtown or close proximity, den/workspace, gym and dog play area either offered by the apartment or in walking distance, nice safe neighborhood, garage or assigned parking and elevator access",,,,,
Agent,Got it! I’ll send some options shortly and we’ll start to narrow down your favorites to tour on your visit,,,,,
Lead,You have no idea how much this will assist me in my move. Thanks so much for your help. I truly appreciate it!,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is all mine!,,,,,
Agent,"Just emailed your list
 
Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

Some prices you’ll see over $1800 are running specials (Ex. 6 weeks free) so monthly price will be in price range with special prorated. 
For example: 1900 + 1 month free = $1753/month on a 13 month lease 

Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll start setting them up when it gets a little closer to your visit dates!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 

I’m able to do that when I’m listed as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Agent,,Voice Message,,,,
Lead,Sounds good!,,,,,
Lead,,Photo,,,,
Lead,Good morning! Here are my top three options and some of the things that stood out for me. ,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning! Okay perfect, the extra info is much appreciated!",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Briana, It’s getting closer to your trip so we can finally start getting clear on the properties you’ll be touring when you visit!",,,,,
Agent,Are you still looking for the same details? 1 bed + study or two bed under $1800?,,,,,
Lead,"Hi ashanti - yes I would but can we also see at least two, 1 bedrooms for around $1500?",,,,,
Agent,"Sure, no problem. What would you be looking for in a 1 bedroom? Any certain amount of space, etc?",,,,,
Lead,Close to at least 700 ft.²,,,,,
Lead,Same qualifications as before,,,,,
Agent,Okay got it!,,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,Don’t mention it!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Briana, I just emailed some new options. Click any listing to see your full list. Note that the options I sent over budget, they are running specials (Ex. 6 weeks free) and will be under our monthly budget when you self-prorate the special. ",,,,,
Agent,Let me know all that you’ll want to tour!,,,,,
Lead,"OK, great thanks I’ll take a look shortly!",,,,,
Agent,Sounds great!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Briana, which options did you decide you wanted to add to tours?",,,,,
Lead,Hi Ashanti! I’ll be sending you my final options by this evening! I’ve been doing research on the areas. I’m trying to be as strategic as possible!,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good! I’ll be on the lookout!,,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, I would love to view the Langford, the Trinity, the Beckley on Trinity, bishop highline, and indie deep ellum please!",,,,,
Agent,Perfect! The plan is still to be in town March 2-4 right? Do you want to do all tours on the 3rd or break them up?,,,,,
Lead,I’ll be there 4-6th. I Would love to do as many as possible on the 4th. My flight arrives at noon. Just to be safe maybe see the first place at 3 and cram as many in as possible?,,,,,
Agent,"Okay perfect, we can start at 3. We can safely schedule at least 3 maybe even 4. and leave one or two for the next morning. That work?",,,,,
Lead,Sounds great!,,,,,
Agent,I’ll have them scheduled! It may be too early to schedule some now but you’ll start to get confirmations in your email and I’ll text you with the full schedule when they’re all confirmed!,,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is mine!,,,,,
Agent,Hey Briana! Hope you’re almost ready for your visit next week! 4/5 of your tours are scheduled. We’re just waiting on confirmation of the last one and I’ll send your full schedule. Let me know if you have any questions!,,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,My pleasure!,,,,,
Lead,,Voice Message,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, looks like I had something scheduled for today? Is this a mistake?",,,,,
Agent,"Yes disregard, I’ll fix it, thanks for letting me know!",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Briana! Here’s your final schedule:

Tuesday, March 4 
3 PM – the Trinity 
4 PM – the Beckley on Trinity 
5 PM – the Langford 

Wednesday, March 5 
10 AM - Indie Deep Ellum
10:30 AM – Bishop Highline 

Availability was tight Wednesday but we’ve let Bishop Highline know you may be a little late. Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Lead,Thanks so much ashanti!,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is mine!,,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti! I have a couple questions. Will you be attending these showings with me? Also, because we complete all the tours Wednesday am I able to make my final decision by Thursday or Friday? Am I able to sign the lease and submit required payment electronically?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Briana! No, I won’t be on your with you but I’ll be available via call/text/voice message! And yes you’ll be able to make your final decision the next day or two. Application, approval, and signing your lease can all be done electronically. ",,,,,
Agent,I know you were wanting a unit with a den or 2 bed but also interested in 1 bedrooms under $1500 and over 700sqft. Let me know what your ideal unit space and number of rooms are and I’ll send the best available units you’d be interested in,,,,,
Lead,Thanks for all your help! I’ll call if I need anything!,,,,,
Agent,The pleasure is all mine! Okay sounds perfect!,,,,,
Agent,Morning Briana! ☀️ Good luck with today’s tours! Again I’ll be here if you need! After today’s tours we’ll talk about everything 👍🏼,,,,,
Agent,We can try Jefferson Innova. It’ll be close to Uptown but not directly in it. It’s along i75. Still running into the issue of not necessarily being walking distance to much,,,,,
Agent,…still searching,,,,,
Lead,Ok sounds good. Looked online and the building is nice!,,,,,
Agent,"Perfect! For those, gross income will need to be 2.5x rent but UNDER $108,080 per year to qualify",,,,,
Agent,And best unit for your move date will be #108 which is first floor. Available 4/30,,,,,
Lead,Yea that’s fine ,,,,,
Lead,Ok would I be able to check it out today?,,,,,
Agent,"I’m trying to get in touch but no luck. Best option is to walk-in and let them know you’re only here for the day and looking to lease asap. 

The floorplan you’d want to see is the A4, which I don’t think they have any available to see but you can hopefully see a similar floor plan, the amenities and they may have a video of the A4 to show you",,,,,
Lead,Ok that’s what I’ll do! I’ll head over after we check out bishop highline.,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good!,,,,,
Agent,Still searching for others…,,,,,

Lead,,Audio message,,,,
Agent,,Audio message,,,,
Lead,I put you down as my reference! ,,,,,
Agent,Thank you! So happy we found the right one! Please let me know when they get back to you with a decision 👌🏼,,,,,
Agent,Hey Briana! Making sure communication with Jefferson has been good. Have they given final approval yet?,,,,,
Lead,Hey ashanti! Still waiting to hear! I just submitted my employment verification Friday so hopefully I get something soon.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay sounds good! I’ll be standing by, here to help if you need",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Briana, making sure you’re all set! Has Jefferson given you final approval yet?",,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti! Yeah, I guess I filled out the asset form in correctly so I submitted that last Thursday. I just followed up with them this morning actually and they said my paperwork was submitted and they were just waiting on the approval. Once that is all set, I will receive a welcome home And lease paperwork to be signed.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay perfect! Almost there! As always, I’m here if you need",,,,,
Lead,Thanks! I definitely wasn’t expecting the process to take this long even though I had to re-sign a form. She mentioned that because they go through a third-party to verify everything it usually takes 2 weeks!😳,,,,,
Lead,Is that normal?,,,,,
Agent,Of course! 2 weeks is definitely on the longer end. Re-signing things can prolong but even still on the longer side. Hopefully she’s an under promise/over deliver kind of person!,,,,,
Lead,,Photo,,,,
Lead,Finally!🎉,,,,,
Agent,🥳🥳🥳,,,,,
Agent,Congratulations!!! I’m so happy you did it. One step closer to the big move!!,,,,,
Lead,Thanks again for all your help! ,,,,,
Agent,"It was a pleasure to help! When you get a chance can you send over these details so we can invoice Jefferson and prepare your $200 rebate 😌

- Unit number
– Lease term 
– Base rent 
– Any specials received",,,,,
Lead,,Pdf,,,,
Lead,I’m pretty sure I’m supposed to get the admin fee reimbursed ,,,,,
Agent,Okay perfect! Thank you so much for the info. And thanks for working with me! Expect your rebate within 60-90 days of moving in. That’s the general timeframe when your apartment pays the invoice so usually a nice surprise! I’ll still be here throughout your lease so if there’s anything I can do whatsoever never hesitate to ask! And if any friends or family of yours find themselves looking for an apartment the best compliment I could ever receive is the opportunity to work with them 😊,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Briana, happy move in day! I hope everything goes smoothly. I’m always here to help where I can!",,,,,
Lead,Thank you Ashanti! I’ll be in Dallas around 5p,,,,,
Agent,Of course! Sounds perfect,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Briana, wishing all is well! How has everything been at The Jefferson since moving in?",,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,

Agent,"Hey Cyrelle, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form! I’m happy to help you find your next apartment and share any post info from my Instagram page. 
 
What areas/neighborhoods are you considering? ",,,,,
Lead,,,Photo,,,
Lead,This general area,,,,,
Lead,"Ideally, 2/1 within $1,500 so I can live a little. Pet friendly - it’s just my cat and I",,,,,
Lead,🙏🏽🙏🏽,,,,,
Agent,Got it. Do you have a lease ending or is your move date flexible? Are you open to one bedrooms also?,,,,,
Lead,"Open to 1|1, and I’m flexible",,,,,
Agent,What is the most ideal move date for you?,,,,,
Lead,Mar 1,,,,,
Lead,And I work remotely so I wanted to have an office/guest room,,,,,
Agent,Okay got it. Will weekends be best for your tours?,,,,,
Lead,"Yes sir, I’m in FL rn and have a friend there. I plan to fly in on a Friday and tour Sat and Sun?",,,,,
Agent,Okay Friday Jan 24?,,,,,
Lead,1/31,,,,,
Agent,*Liked message,,,,,
Lead,Would I be able to see listings before seeing them irl?,,,,,
Agent,"Absolutely, I’ll send a list of options for you to choose favorites from",,,,,
Agent,,RentalRequirements photo,,,,
Agent,"Lastly, are you all good with these requirements?",,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Lead,All clear 😇,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is mine! And perfect. I’ll send some options this weekend and we’ll start having your tours scheduled for when you visit!,,,,,
Lead,Sounds great! ,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, I was wondering you could send over the listings?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Cyrelle, sorry for the delay! I just emailed your list
 
Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽

Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up for when you arrive next weekend!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 

I’m able to do that when I’m listed as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Cyrelle, which options did you decide on touring?",,,,,
Lead,"I have to look at them again to make sure, I’ll have it made up by tonight",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, sounds perfect ",,,,,
Lead,"This is tough. I have them all as ‘favorites’. I guess it will depend on availability as well to move in by or around 3/1. If it’s gonna be a 1BR, I’d prefer to keep it within $1,200 so I can continue to be pretty comfortable",,,,,
Lead,"Here are the 5 I’d like to tour next weekend:
Auxo at Memorial,
Azure Houston,
3800 Main,
Allister Galleria,
Providence Uptown",,,,,
Agent,"Good evening. Okay, a few things. Some of the favorites you chose are income restricted and your annual income needs to be under $45,420 to qualify. Many other apartments you chose were built in the 1900’s so aesthetically will be very outdated in person. 

If you want to keep costs low there are a few apartments I can suggest but many you choose I couldn’t recommend. They’re simply too old and outdated. If you want to see them, you can but I will also make sure you see my suggestions. 

First, so I know what you can qualify for and if you qualify for essential housing units. What is your gross monthly income?",,,,,
Lead,"My gross ranges from 4,500 to 6k/mo",,,,,
Lead,And up to 9k/mo during a good season(s),,,,,
Lead,I’m down to see your recommendations - will you send those by email?,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, so you wouldn’t qualify for those essential housing units. But I can definitely find you a few options in the $1200’s and even less. And they don’t need to be super old to get that price. But you may need to be open to areas slightly outside of the cut out you sent me (I’ll suggest some inside as well) and you’ll need to trust me. Most of the apartments you found under $1200 are essential housing that you won’t qualify for.",,,,,
Agent,I’ll rework the recommendations in your list and let you know when to go back in and check them out ,,,,,
Lead,"Hmm. I noticed that about 3800 Main, only",,,,,
Lead,"And when you get a chance to explain how this works, I would appreciate it",,,,,
Agent,"3800 main, 2121 Ella, Azure Houston, Caroline Post oak, and a few others. Their lower priced units are all essential housing. Anything with a P6 or P8 for most building. For 2121 Ella, floor plans are marked with an “E”",,,,,
Agent,"The $200 rebate is sent directly to your bank via Zelle and you’ll receive it the same day I’m paid. That is generally 60-90 days from the date you move in once my company receives payment from the apartment you choose. 

The free move is a $200 move credit. I recommend the rebate every time since the move doesn’t turn out to be free and sometimes you won’t get the full $200 value. The rebate is $200 cash sent straight to you",,,,,
Lead,Interesting! Thank for the details on that. It’s surprising that a lot of those buildings are like that. I’ll be on the lookout for your new recommendations within range - thanks for your kind understand and assistance. I don’t mean to seem cheap but I work in commission and it’s pretty unpredictable lol,,,,,
Lead,"So to run it back
1 BRs < $1,200
2 BRs | 1BA < $1,400",,,,,
Agent,"Happy to share details! I’ll update recommendations tomorrow 👍🏼

I understand 100%! I’m fully commission as well lol",,,,,
Agent,Please allow me to send 1 BR deals up to $1300. It will open up your options noticeably. You’ll still see deals under $1200 and I’ll keep 2BR under $1400,,,,,
Lead,"I’ve noticed a lot of places have a “desk” area/corners - for a 1 BR, I’d prefer to have something like that so I can sleep peacefully without my work monitors visible in the bedroom to stare at",,,,,
Agent,Prefer desk area in the bedroom or living room?,,,,,
Lead,"The living room, preferably discreet",,,,,
Agent,Noted 👍🏼,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Cyrelle, I updated your list. To see it you can go into the original email and click any apartment listing

I separated them into “Recommendations” which has all recommendations. And “Favorites” which has units that either have 2 bedrooms, an extra study space, or built in desk. 

The only apartments you’ll see over budget is Allora Bear Creek and The Westover at West Branch and that’s because they are running a 2 month free special. Special price will look like this: $1458 + 2 months free = $1215 per month. So you’ll still be within budget each month when you self-prorate the special. 

If you want to add options of your own, that’s more than OK, just let me know which ones you add so I can point out if they are essential units that you might not qualify for or another reason I may have left them off the list 👍🏼. 

Let me know which you want to tour and I’ll have them scheduled for you!",,,,,
Lead,"Great. I’ll check them out after work today, thank you!",,,,,
Agent,Sounds perfect. My pleasure!,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, I’ve updated my favorites last night to tour next Sat and Sun!",,,,,
Lead,,Photo,,,,
Lead,"I’ve opened up my location options further west in the highlighted, too",,,,,
Agent,Sounds perfect! I’ll have them scheduled for you,,,,,
Agent,Noted locations as well 👍🏼,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Cyrelle, the two apartments you added to favorites, Pearl Woodlake & Flats on Tangkewilde. Do you want to add those to your tours?",,,,,
Lead,Yes please. I also want to cancel Metropole. I apologize for any inconvenience.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, no worries. I’ll have them booked!",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Cyrelle, will you be flying in Friday early enough to tour? 

Milwee Street will conflict with your Saturday schedule and is closed on Sunday. Best we can do is tour Friday or Monday or do a virtual tour",,,,,
Lead,Monday would work - I work 8-4,,,,,
Lead,"If I find the right one on during the weekend, it wouldn’t be too inconvenient to just cancel it, right?",,,,,
Agent,Okay. No we’d be fine to cancel. Can I schedule Monday at 4:30pm for now?,,,,,
Lead,Sure,,,,,
Agent,*Liked message,,,,,
Agent,"Here’s your upcoming schedule. Let me know if you have any questions/changes/concerns!

Lead,Let’s do it!,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, I’m sorry, could we please cancel the viewing for Pearl Woodlake?",,,,,
Agent,"Good morning. Okay, they’ll be cancelled. ",,,,,
Agent,"I won’t be touring with you today. But if you have any questions or concerns whatsoever, just call/text/send a voice note!",,,,,
Lead,I believe I found the place and will complete an app today. Please cancel the other appointments. Thank you so much 😎,,,,,
Agent,That’s amazing! Which apartment did you decide on?,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Cyrelle, on your application please look out for the referral section. Update me on which you’re going with when you get a chance 👌🏼",,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, I didn’t see a section to input a referral. The leasing specialist is aware tho I was referred by you, a locator - I went with Eclipse",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, thanks for letting them know. That’s perfect, I’m really happy we found the right one!",,,,,
Agent,"When you get a chance can you send this info so my team can invoice Eclipse properly:

Unit #
Base rent
Move date
Lease term",,,,,
Lead,"1144
$1,319
Mar 27
12 mos",,,,,
Agent,"Thanks! For your $200 rebate, you’ll be paid via Zelle using the number we have on file. You’ll be paid when the property pays and the same day as me. That’s generally 60-90 days from move-in so usually a nice surprise. I’ll still be here to help so if you have any questions or concerns never hesitate to reach out!",,,,,
Lead,🙌🙌,,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, does APTAMIGO have a referral program?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Cyrelle, what do you mean?",,,,,
Lead,"If I refer a friend to work with you, who’s looking to move",,,,,
Agent,We can offer $50 per referral that ends up working with us that leases an apartment,,,,,
Lead,Oh okay!,,,,,
Agent,The referral would come from me though not necessarily any agent so if you have anyone just send them over to me!,,,,,
Lead,I gotcha,,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, do you assist people looking for apartments in Las Vegas?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Cyrelle,  no I don’t I’m sorry",,,,,
Agent,Hey Cyrelle! I hope all is well. Hire has everything been at Eclipse?,,,,,
Lead,"It’s all good here. I got that incentive too by the way, once again ty ty 🫶🏽",,,,,
Agent,That’s great to hear! And perfect 👌🏼 pleasure has been all mine! ,,,,,
Agent,I love helping friends and family also so if you know anyone who could use my help please send them over! 😌,,,,,
Lead,I got your number saved and will keep you in mind!,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good to me!,,,,,
