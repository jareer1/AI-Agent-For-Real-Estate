Agent,"Hey Jyesha, it’s Ashanti. This is my cell so reach me anytime here.",,,,,
Lead,"Okay, Thank you!",,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Okay, Thank you!”",,,,,
Agent,…And thank you!,,,,,
Lead,Loved “…And thank you!”,,,,,
Agent,"Hey, good morning! How did you make out? Did you go ahead and apply or still weighing options?",,,,,
Lead,"Good morning! I believe thats the one I’m going to go with. If I was to apply today, that means the apartment’s quote could have changed? Also, is it a chance I could get a different apartment than the one she mention in the tour?",,,,,
Agent,The quote was for 48 hours of our tour so literally about now. The page to apply on the website seems to be down so I think you should call and tell them you’re trying to apply within your 48 hour window and it’s not letting you. You can choose any unit you want,,,,,
Lead,"Okay, cool beans. No answer surprisingly. 
 
 Harlow’s rate is still the same?",,,,,
Agent,"Price is actually still the same for Pearl. Cheaper if you want to set move date for the next two weeks. You have a 4 units to choose from. 
 
 Harlow went up actually. $1308 is the lowest price. Available now",,,,,
Lead,Loved “Price is actually still the same for Pearl. Cheape…”,,,,,
Agent,Good morning! Are you all set with your application to Pearl? I’ve been checking in with Harlow and still no price drop yet,,,,,
Lead,Hey Ashanti! Thank you! And I got cold feet. 😮‍💨I’m going to think on it for a day or two.,,,,,
Agent,Okay! Don’t feel pressure. Make it feel right! I’ll run another search tomorrow to see if there are other options that might work better,,,,,
Lead,Thanks so much!,,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Of course!”,,,,,
Agent,"Good Morning! ☀️Here’s a few more to look at. District and The Peri would be a similar distance from work as Pearl Woodlake and Smart Living Heights is inside the loop! Let me know if you’d like to see either of them
 
 District at Memorial
 Studio | $1097 | 572 sqft
 1/1 | $1189 | 695 sqft
 
 The Peri on Westheimer
 1/1 | $1114 | 712 sqft 
 
 Smart Living Heights
 1/1 | $1230 | 631 sqft",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jyesha, checking on your search. Do you still need more options to look at?",,,,,
Lead,Loved “Good Morning! ☀️Here’s a few more to look at. Dist…”,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, and I like District at Memorial. I would like to see that one.",,,,,
Agent,"Good morning, sorry for the late reply. When would you like to see District at Memorial?",,,,,
Lead,"Good morning! No worries, Friday is great.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I requested a tour online. They didn’t specify date so should be reaching out to you.",,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Good morning! No worries, Friday is great.”",,,,,

Agent,Sounds perfect 👍🏼,,,,,
Agent,Good morning! Noticed the unit isn’t there anymore. Hoping that was you who applied!,,,,,
Lead,Good Morning and It was! I hoped on it real fast. Lol,,,,,
Agent,Lol perfect! 🙌🏼,,,,,
Agent,Please keep me in the loop once they get back to you about approval,,,,,
Lead,"Definitely will, Thank you!",,,,,
Agent,Thanks! Pleasure is mine!,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Thanks! Pleasure is mine!”,,,,,
Lead,"Good morning, I’m still in the process. 
 
 How does the renter’s verification work? Is it requires that they speak with a former landlord?",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, thanks for the update. 
 
 Many times it’s a 3rd party to screen and see if you’ve ever had any broken leases or missed or late payments. It’s possible they call and verify rental history themselves though",,,,,
Lead,Ooh okay gotcha,,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti, my application has been approved. I’m about to move forward with signing the lease.",,,,,
Agent,"Awesome!! Congratulations!!🍾 That sounds perfect 👍
 
 Can you ask them for the form for you to fill out for the locator referral please",,,,,

Agent,No worries! Thanks!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jyesha! Hope all is well, I just wanted to check on how things are going. How’s everything at your apartment?",,,,,
Lead,"Heyyy !
 Sorry for my super late response. 
 
 I like my apartment. It’s just the management that I’m not happy with. They really don’t communicate with residents well.",,,,,
Agent,Hey! No worries. I’m so sorry to hear that! It’s really unfortunate some offices don’t prioritize communication with their residents. Is there anything in particular you’ve experienced that you can let me know?,,,,,
Lead,"Sure ,
 Well my car was towed from the parking lot. When I inquired about it, I was told it was because I didn’t register correctly but they were not able or willing to tell me the correct way because they website you register on is ran by the towing company. 
 
 Now they are telling us we can’t have mats outside our door or ring cameras with no explanation. 
 
 We only have two working treadmills in the gym.",,,,,
Agent,Wow I’m so sorry. I’m going to share this with my team. Properties that start giving clients major issues we monitor and will stop sending people if the building isn’t caring for the residents well. Thanks for the feedback and if anything else arises don’t hesitate to let me know! In some cases I can reach out to their corporate management company to see what can be done,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Wow I’m so sorry. I’m going to share this with my …”,,,,,
Lead,"Okay, will do and thank you!",,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Okay, will do and thank you! ”",,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jyesha, it’s Ashanti. I just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,

Agent,My pleasure! Sounds perfect,,,,,
Lead,"Hi, I like these two: Broadstone Amelia, Avasa Spring Branch",,,,,
Agent,"Hey, okay perfect. Does Saturday work best to tour or another day this week?",,,,,
Lead,I can do Saturday before I work at 1pm and Monday after 11am,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll let you know when they’re both scheduled",,,,,
Agent,…wanted to make sure you realized that Broadstone Amelia has no balconies,,,,,
Lead,"Oooh I didn’t notice. I’ll still like to tour tho. Also, I’ll add Filament at the Grid. Thank you !!",,,,,

Agent,"Hey Jyesha, here’s your schedule for this Monday, Jan 13
 
 12 PM – Broadstone Amelia 
 1 PM – Avasa spring branch 
 2 PM – Filament at the grid
 
 Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Lead,"Okay, Thank you !",,,,,

Agent,Perfect! I’ll be here if you need me,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jyesha, how did everything go yesterday?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey, quick follow up! Are we still searching or do you think we found the right one?",,,,,
Lead,"Heyyy Ashanti, sorry for my late response. 
 
 I enjoyed all the tours. I’m really like Filament at Grid because of their location and reduce rates. I may move forward with them not sure yet tho.",,,,,
Agent,"No worries. That’s great news! Let me know what you ultimately decide. Is there anything about Filament that’s got you hesitant, that I can try to look again to make sure your 100% sure about the decision?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jyesha, wanted to follow up as we go into the weekend to make sure you’re all good. Is there anything I can do or search for to reassure you of your apt choices?",,,,,
Lead,"Hey Ashanti 
 Hmmmm… I am a little curious to see what else else is in the Stanford area because I really like the area Filament at the Grid is in.",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jyesha, Stafford area really doesn’t have much in terms of new apartments. 
 
 They have Filament at the Grid, Lenox at the grid, Arc at the grid, and 1879 at the grid. And they’re all within walking distance of each other. 
 
 Lenox and Filament are the newest of the four and Filament is best in my opinion. From the community to upkeep, staff, etc
 
 One newer property close though is Espria, you can check those out if you want, just lmk",,,,,
Agent,Esprialiving.com,,,,,
Agent,Hey good afternoon. Did you want to see Espria?,,,,,
Lead,"Sorry for the late response. Things have been so hectic with covering the winter storm. My car got broken into as well. 
 
 Yes, I want to see it. I’m available all day today and tomorrow.",,,,,

Agent,I’ll get you scheduled now,,,,,
Agent,You’re scheduled for tomorrow at 12pm,,,,,
Lead,Okay perfect,,,,,
Agent,Morning! ☀️ let me know how it goes today. Call or text if you need anything,,,,,
Lead,"Heyy, everything went well. Just going to take the next day or two to weigh my options",,,,,
Agent,"Okay perfect, I’ll be here to answer any questions. And if you apply before we speak again, please look out for the referral section on the app",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jyesha, just checking in making sure you’re still all good?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jyesha, checking in again. Are you all good? Any questions/concerns I can address?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey, are you all good?",,,,,
Lead,"Heyy Ashanti, everything’s good. I haven’t decided on which apartment yet. I plan too very soon .",,,,,
Agent,Okay sounds good. Are you torn between apts you’ve seen already or still thinking there are others out there you want to explore?,,,,,
Lead,The ones I’ve seen.I know for sure I want to be in the Stafford area so I’m stuck between filament at the grid and Espira.,,,,,
Agent,"Got it. Well if it helps at all, I’ve placed many people at Filament and they all love their experience so far. I haven’t placed anyone at Espria myself but a few of my team members have and said dealing with the office has been difficult when trying to advocate for their clients regarding different issues, one of them being mold in the apartment. If the race between the two is really close, I’d look for patterns in reviews. One off negative reviews don’t paint a picture but be careful of patterns. Patterns in reviews tend to have some truth to them. Just my input",,,,,
Lead,"Okay, thank you!! Definitely taking that into consideration",,,,,
Agent,Absolutely!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jyesha, wanted to check on you again. How’s it going with the decision making?",,,,,
Lead,"Heyy, thanks so much for your patience through out this whole process. It’s going good. I went back and looked at the original recommendations you sent me. I would like to look at 1879 at the Grid.",,,,,
Lead,And Lenox at the Grid,,,,,
Agent,"Hey, of course, that’s what I’m here for. When would you like me to schedule those for?",,,,,

Lead,,IMG_0716.jpeg,,,,
Agent,"Hi Danielle! Thanks for reaching out. These are in Conroe and don’t allow broken leases, bankruptcies, misdemeanors, or felonies. Is that all okay?",,,,,
Lead,Yes that’s fine.,,,,,
Agent,Okay great. Last tour for today is at 5pm. Pretty open for the rest of the week. What day works best for you?,,,,,
Lead,Can the two month be prorated into the rent?,,,,,
Lead,How much is the application and admin fee?,,,,,
Lead,It’s 1204 for a 2 bedroom 2 bath?,,,,,
Agent,"Yes, the 2 months free is credited to your account upon move in, so you can use it to prorate straight from your resident account. 
 
 Application: $50 per applicant
 Admin: $150
 
 Yes, the market rate for 2bed 2 bath unit is $1445. With the 2 month free special prorated you will be paying $1204 per month. Note, you’ll still need to qualify at the market rate of $1445 before the special is applied",,,,,
Agent,Best deal in Conroe hands down. Let me know what day works best for your tour!,,,,,
Lead,What would cause me not to qualify?,,,,,
Lead,Thank you so much for the through explanation.,,,,,
Agent,,Rental Requirements.PNG,,,,

Lead,My credit score isn’t a 600 yet.,,,,,
Lead,My FICO isn’t.,,,,,
Agent,Are you currently renting? Or a first time renter?,,,,,
Lead,I’m currently renting now.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, credit isn’t a make or break. Your full profile (income, rental history, credit, background) will be considered. About what is your credit score?",,,,,
Lead,My FICO is a 544,,,,,

Lead,I was today but something came up unfortunately….,,,,,
Lead,Let me see what I can do.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, please send me a quick heads up when you’re going to submit. I want to make sure you get the best deal they have available",,,,,
Lead,I’ll complete today. So what exactly changed?,,,,,
Lead,The months?,,,,,
Lead,Instead 12 months 2months free it’s 18 months 2 months free?,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, sounds good",,,,,
Agent,"Yes, correct",,,,,
Agent,At 12 months it’ll be 6 week free. At 18 months it’ll be 2 months free,,,,,
Lead,Gotcha… wow that’s a long term lease.,,,,,
Lead,And that’s on any two bed room apartment.,,,,,
Agent,Yes any 2 bedroom. With the 6 weeks free on a 12 month lease your base rent prorated amount would be $1264 per month so still a really great deal if you decided on 12 months instead of 18,,,,,
Lead,Gotcha yes both of them are good.,,,,,
Lead,Can we prorate one month and use one free month up front?,,,,,
Agent,I believe it is a credit that you get to your account so you can use the special however you like,,,,,
Lead,"Oh awesome, ok good.",,,,,
Lead,Do I need a link to gain access to the application?,,,,,

Lead,Yes unfortunately it’s too far.,,,,,
Lead,You know of anything closer in?,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, that’s what I’m here for. Yes I know plenty. Ariza is the best price on a 2/2 hands down for a new construction but I can find what you’re looking for. 
 
 What’s the max budget you want to stay under?",,,,,
Lead,1400 a month,,,,,
Agent,What area are you looking to stay?,,,,,
Lead,"Spring, Humble, Champions, Cypress, Jersey Village, Fallbrook Richmond, Katy or Pearland.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, and you need a 2/2 or is 1 bedroom okay?",,,,,

Agent,No not generally. Regular availability for the most part,,,,,
Lead,Oh ok… cool,,,,,
Lead,I’ve called a couple and there’s a waiting list.,,,,,
Lead,But that’s good.,,,,,
Agent,"Some may, but when I’ve seen waiting lists it’s generally on you to stay on top of the property. They only call if they go from 0% available to having a unit available and no prospects which isn’t too likely",,,,,
Lead,"Oh ok, I see…",,,,,
Agent,"Here are a few to check out that that will be under $1400 after specials

Agent,Good afternoon. Only Avenue M has a special which is 1 month free + only $99 app & admin and $0 deposit with approved credit,,,,,
Lead,Dang… I missed all the good stuff😳,,,,,
Agent,"I wouldn’t say that. Everlee and Smart Living garden oaks didn’t have specials even back when you were looking before. Everlee even went down to $1336, but only has one available. Two bedrooms in the $1300’s are extremely rare to begin with so it’s fortunate there’s something available at these properties",,,,,
Lead,Oh ok so Everlee has only one available now?,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Good afternoon. Only Avenue M has a special which …”,,,,,

 Agent: Ashanti DePass",,,,,
Agent,Let me know if you have any questions,,,,,
Lead,Loved “When applying you will see the question “How did y…”,,,,,
Lead,Liked “Let me know if you have any questions”,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Danielle, making sure you’re all set with the app? Were you able to submit, no issues?",,,,,
Lead,I ran into a slight issue with my paycheck stubs.,,,,,
Lead,I’m trying to get that situated.,,,,,
Lead,I would need to submit that when I submit the application?,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, yes you will need to submit it together.",,,,,
Agent,I want to make sure you submit before any price changes though. How long will you need to postpone?,,,,,
Lead,Honestly I work but I’m trying to get some paychecks made. So I can make three times the rent.,,,,,
Lead,I can afford it but I receive help as well.,,,,,
Lead,Just being honest between me and you.,,,,,
Agent,What is your own gross monthly income?,,,,,
Lead,I don’t know right off the top of my head I’m working as we speak and I just started this job. 22 dollars an hour.,,,,,
Agent,40 hours a week?,,,,,
Lead,Yes,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I definitely don’t recommend you alter paystubs. Apts use software now that spots those things easily and when they find it you’ll be banned from that property for good. 
 
 Whats the absolute latest you can move?",,,,,
Lead,I won’t alter them.,,,,,
Lead,"Loved “Okay, I definitely don’t recommend you alter payst…”",,,,,
Lead,Don’t worry I’ll take care it.,,,,,
Agent,Okay,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Danielle, keep me updated with everything so I know when to activate your $200 rebate or free move",,,,,
Lead,"Loved “Hey Danielle, keep me updated with everything so I…”",,,,,
Lead,Hey I will I’m working on some things over here but tell me about the free move in.,,,,,
Lead,I think that’s what I’m going to go with.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, the free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate because the move usually never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay a move deposit and you just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out.",,,,,
Lead,"Loved “Okay, the free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestl…”",,,,,
Lead,Gotcha…,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Danielle, checking in quick. Let me know how everything is moving along or if we’re still waiting",,,,,
Lead,Yes! I’m waiting on my documents then I’ll proceed with submitting everything. No later than Monday.,,,,,
Agent,"Sounds perfect! Keep me updated. And very important, please look out for the referral section on the application to add me as your locator. Thats how we can pay your $200 rebate",,,,,
Lead,Ok sounds good….,,,,,
Lead,How long is the application process?,,,,,
Lead,Do they use a thorough system?,,,,,
Agent,It can be a couple days to up to a week depending on what documents they need from you. I’m not sure the system they use for applications,,,,,
Lead,Loved “It can be a couple days to up to a week depending…”,,,,,
Lead,"Good morning, How do I go about filling out the application?",,,,,
Lead,Where?,,,,,
Lead,Found it thanks!,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Found it thanks!”,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning, I’ll be here if you have any questions",,,,,
Lead,"Loved “Good morning, I’ll be here if you have any questio…”",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Danielle, making sure you’re all good. Were you able to apply no issues?",,,,,
Lead,I’m applying tonite…. I’ve been working so much. Bu fasure tonite.,,,,,
Lead,I have everything I needed squared away…,,,,,
Lead,No specials for August?,,,,,
Agent,Okay. We never know specials. They add them and take them away without warning based on capacity,,,,,
Lead,Can you find out for me right quick I’m just curious to know I’m working at this very moment.,,,,,
Agent,Find out what?,,,,,
Lead,Any specials for August…,,,,,
Agent,Just spoke to them. They’re not unfortunately,,,,,
Lead,Dang…,,,,,
Lead,Ok,,,,,
Lead,Just wondering,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’m sorry. Keep me updated on your application",,,,,
Lead,No problem will do…,,,,,
Lead,Thank you for checking for me…,,,,,
Agent,Okay. Of course,,,,,
Lead,Ok I finally submitted it lol,,,,,
Lead,What’s normally the process time?,,,,,
Lead,For the application,,,,,
Lead,I called them and no one answered.,,,,,
Agent,Okay perfect lol. Usually about a week. Depends on if they need any more documents from you. No movement usually over the weekends because managers are typically off then. So I’d say yall will communicate and get a final approval decision around this time next week,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Okay perfect lol. Usually about a week. Depends on…”,,,,,
Lead,"Ok, sound good…",,,,,
Lead,Say a prayer for me!,,,,,
Agent,Emphasized “Say a prayer for me! ”,,,,,
Agent,🙏🏼,,,,,
Lead,Loved “🙏🏼”,,,,,
Lead,Hi! Can you call them for me please.,,,,,
Lead,I’m kinda confused.,,,,,
Lead,I see a security deposit posted and a couple of other questionable things…,,,,,
Lead,Then I see the apartment I applied for is not Available.,,,,,
Lead,Is it because I’m approved for it?,,,,,
Lead,I know they’ll answer for you.,,,,,
Lead,I just attempted to call…,,,,,
Lead,It said security deposit 150.00,,,,,
Agent,What’s questionable about the security deposit? Once you apply it gets taken off the website until you either get approved or denied,,,,,
Lead,Isn’t that only required once you’re approved?,,,,,
Lead,It wasn’t there when I filled out the application.,,,,,
Lead,Yesterday…,,,,,
Agent,It depends on the property. I’ll try calling in a sec to ask,,,,,
Lead,"Ok
 Thanks",,,,,
Lead,Liked “It depends on the property. I’ll try calling in a …”,,,,,
Agent,No problem,,,,,
Lead,Any word?,,,,,
Agent,No they haven’t picked up. I’ll keep trying periodically until they close,,,,,
Lead,Liked “No they haven’t picked up. I’ll keep trying period…”,,,,,
Lead,"Ok, thanks!",,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Ok, thanks!”",,,,,
Lead,No Luck?,,,,,
Agent,Nothing. I called 5 times,,,,,
Lead,Yeah calling now…,,,,,
Lead,No answer,,,,,
Lead,Nor can you leave a message.,,,,,
Lead,Crazy…,,,,,
Lead,Thanks anyways…,,,,,
Agent,"Dang, hopefully better luck tomorrow",,,,,
Agent,No problem,,,,,
Lead,Loved “No problem”,,,,,
Lead,I hope so…,,,,,
Agent,Emphasized “I hope so…”,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Danielle, checking up on you real quick. Have they updated you on your application?",,,,,
Lead,I drop the ball…,,,,,
Lead,Everything processed and was going great.,,,,,
Lead,I mistakenly submitted the wrong S.S number rushing🤦🏽‍♀️,,,,,
Lead,I can’t locate my card.,,,,,
Lead,So I had to reapply for another one.,,,,,
Lead,They’re only willing to see my card and nothing else.,,,,,
Lead,So now I have to wait until my card come in to continue the application process.,,,,,
Lead,I’m so mad at myself…,,,,,
Agent,"Dang, have you already applied for your new ss card? How long until you get it?",,,,,
Lead,Yes yesterday and I did it takes approximately 2 weeks. I gave them the temporary paper with my social security number yesterday but they didn’t honor it.,,,,,
Lead,They call me this morning and told me the manager said no.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, hopefully just a little delay. Let me know once your card comes in and you’re able to submit again",,,,,
Lead,Ok will do…,,,,,
Lead,I’m so upset,,,,,
Lead,Everything else came back ok.,,,,,
Agent,It’s okay. When it comes back we move forward. If they just need that everything should be fine,,,,,
Lead,I had everything planned out.,,,,,
Lead,But it’s ok…,,,,,
Lead,I guess…,,,,,
Agent,It’ll be okay,,,,,
Lead,Loved “It’ll be okay”,,,,,
Lead,Good morning… Just incase what’s option B?,,,,,
Lead,I don’t want to put all my eggs in one basket.,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning. I wouldn’t want you to apply and waste application/admin fees. This option is great since you’re partially approved and if anything happens we’ll take a look. Trust me on it, looking now and potentially waiting 2 weeks for your ss card for an answer from them anyway, we would just end up looking again in 2 weeks. Let this play out and based on what happens will determine what we do",,,,,
Lead,Loved “Good morning. I wouldn’t want you to apply and was…”,,,,,
Lead,"Hi, I’m still waiting on my social security card but I still would like to at least find another apartment as a back up plan just in case.",,,,,
Agent,Okay,,,,,
Agent,I’ll take a look today,,,,,
Lead,Ok thank you…,,,,,

Lead,Johns,,,,,
Lead,Asiahnj@gmail.com,,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,"Thanks! And of course! I just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Keep in mind prices you see are without specials. 
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free 2 hour move (your choice). 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Lead,"Great, thank you for getting it over so quickly! I’ll try to take a look this evening",,,,,
Agent,For sure! Sounds perfect,,,,,
Lead,Hey! How are you ? I was able to go through the list. I would like to go see MILLENNIUM HIGH STREET. Are you able to send some additional options ?,,,,,
Agent,Good morning! Does Tomorrow or Tuesday work for tours?,,,,,
Agent,And one more is 1810 Main. They have a unit for $1555 + 6 weeks free which would bring you under $1400 per month,,,,,

Agent,Cool!,,,,,
Agent,Ran into traffic on 610. GPS says 2:35 now,,,,,
Lead,"Okay, just pulling up.",,,,,
Agent,"Liked “Okay, just pulling up. ”",,,,,
Agent,"There should be a part in the application that says “how did you hear about us?” Or “who referred you?”
 …If there’s a dropdown, choose locator/realtor if there’s a text box just put my info, Ashanti w/ Nav Agency 👌🏽
 
 Good meeting you again. I’ll be around to help the whole process so let me know if you have questions or run into any issues",,,,,

Lead,Hey! I don’t see 633 online 😩,,,,,
Lead,I was about to apply,,,,,
Agent,"Damn smh. They must’ve had mad tours today. I’m sorry, that’s how fast things move. Your best option now would be unit #0733. $1645 + 6 weeks free = $1439/mo.",,,,,
Agent,Either that or keep looking. Thats still the best price right now for a unit that size in a building that new inside the loop,,,,,
Lead,That was quick!,,,,,
Lead,I’m going to apply for that one now,,,,,
Agent,"Very! Okay, let me know once you submit",,,,,
Lead,I’m going to have to submit in the AM once they open. The application won’t allow me to move forward and they charged me for the app fee twice .,,,,,
Agent,"Damn, okay. Keep me in the loop",,,,,

Lead,Good morning! Everything is fully submitted,,,,,

Agent,"Thank you! The free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate because the move usually never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay a move deposit and most times you just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out.",,,,,
Lead,You’re welcome! Do you know approximately how much additional it would be to utilize? I would still have to find movers regardless,,,,,
Agent,"It would be based on number of rooms and your stuff. You’d need to put a deposit of $50-$100. You can try but I’ve just seen it turn out wack too many times and seen costs just the same as if you didn’t have the credit. It’s a new offering from my company and it’s not too structured yet. I steer all my clients to the cash now until they make it better. You’ll thank me for choosing the $200 cash, promise",,,,,
Lead,"Okay sounds good, I’ll do that. Thanks for looking out !",,,,,
Agent,Don’t mention it!,,,,,
Lead,Hey! How are you? Checking in to see the anticipated timeline of getting the $200 credit .,,,,,
Agent,Hey! Hope you’re good. It usually comes 60-90 days after your move in. My company waits for the apt to pay and they pay you out the same day 👌🏽,,,,,
Lead,Perfect! Thank you,,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Lead,Hey! I just gave someone named Tay Tay your number for locating services . I hope that’s okay!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Asiah! Yes that’s fine, thanks for doing it! Did move-in go smooth?",,,,,
Lead,Of course! Yes . It went smoothed and I’m all settled in. Thanks for asking,,,,,
Agent,"Nicee. Of course, I’m glad everything went well. The 60-90 days for your $200 started on your move date so when we collect from 1810 is when you’ll receive it. It’s sent via Zelle and you’ll get a text too 👌🏼",,,,,
Lead,Great! Thanks,,,,,
Agent,Liked “Great! Thanks ”,,,,,
Lead,Good morning ! I hope all is well. I’m sending someone your number for services. Her name is Jayla.,,,,,

Lead,Happy Holidays ✨,,,,,
Lead,Hey! Are you able to provide an update on when I will receive the $200? I’m coming up on my 90 days in a couple of days,,,,,

Agent,"Got you! I’ll start looking within the next week or so to see what’s out there for September. And cool on the renewal, even better if they get it to you early but you’re only obligated to a 60 day notice (double check your specific lease) so you can wait to submit until 60 days of your lease ending",,,,,
Lead,Okay sounds good and yes they confirmed it’s a 60 day notice,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Okay sounds good and yes they confirmed it’s a 60 …”,,,,,
Agent,Perfect,,,,,
Agent,Hey Elyshia! Just letting you know I’ll be sending some options this week. I’m just waiting for more to show up for September. I don’t want you to see places with no availability showing for your move date,,,,,
Lead,"Hey! Okay sounds great! Thank you! There was a place you posted that I liked, let me find the video. But wanted to know more about it and the location",,,,,
Lead,https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8KiJNFutCN/?igsh=Z2Jrcmw2cjJzYmtl,,,,,
Lead,This one,,,,,
Agent,No prob! Thant one is Lumen! Price was on a smaller unit after specials,,,,,
Lead,"Oooo so it’s more expensive for a 1 bedroom? I thought I seen $1,450 for a one bedroom",,,,,
Agent,"Prices shown are lowest prices after specials. $1450 after specials for 1 bedroom is about right. Some of their units are essential worker units also so your income will need to be under $75,680. Could you qualify for that program?",,,,,
Lead,Yes scratch that one out,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Yes scratch that one out ”,,,,,
Lead,Hey! I have another client for you but he’s needs a place the end of July beginning of August,,,,,
Lead,He sent me some listings he seen on IG and his budget is $1500. He said he would prefer a 2-3 bedroom if possible,,,,,
Agent,"Hey! Okay thanks, want to give them my number?",,,,,
Lead,Yea I’ll send him your number,,,,,
Lead,Let me send you the videos though,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, yeah have him reach out. I’ll want to talk him through these 20+ posts",,,,,

Lead,Hey it’s Elyshia.Hairston@gmail.com,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Hey it’s Elyshia.Hairston@gmail.com”,,,,,
Agent,"Just emailed you. 
 
 There’s really not so much showing for September right now but take a look and let me know which you’ll want to tour. Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling. And as far as lofts for right now I suggest we look at The Rice Downtown Lofts
 
 Let me know if you have any questions, and when you’ll be back in town to start touring 👌🏼",,,,,
Agent,Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free 2hr move (your choice). Just of course need to make sure I’m listed as your referral on your app like last time and let me know which you’ll want for move in,,,,,
Lead,Hey! I’ll be back on Monday and I’ll check it out now,,,,,
Lead,What’s a free 2 hr move?,,,,,
Agent,"Perfect! The free 2hr move is an option we give with a preferred mover. Honestly, the move you never get the full value and you’ll end up out of pocket with fees, etc. I always recommend the cash, it’s paid out via Zelle the same day I’m paid.",,,,,
Lead,Ooo well shoot I’ll do the rebate lol,,,,,
Lead,Okay I think I need to see most of them. I would like to stay on the top floor as well,,,,,

Lead,"Loved “Okay cool, this weekend I’ll see which have top fl…”",,,,,
Lead,Okay sounds good,,,,,
Lead,Thank you,,,,,
Agent,Of course,,,,,
Agent,"Morning Elyshia, it looks like Modera Garden Oaks is the only one with top floor availability. The Travis won’t be top floor because they have penthouse units and same for The Rice since it’s a Highrise you’d pay more for top floor. 
 
 The Rice does have a 833 sqft unit for $1714 on floor 16/18 and a 829 sqft unit for $1851 on floor 17/18. 
 
 A couple others I added with top floor availability are Modera Washington and The Rosslyn Garden Oaks
 
 Let me know which you want to see and what day this week works 👌🏼",,,,,
Lead,"That $1714 on floor 16/18 is fine. For high rises, it doesn’t have to be at the top floor",,,,,
Agent,Okay cool. Let me know what day/time frame works and all that you want to see and I’ll set it up,,,,,
Lead,"Tuesdays and Thursdays I work from home so I can take a lunch break and meet you and Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays has to be after 5 and my Saturdays are free",,,,,
Agent,"Sorry, crazy long day. But okay, I’ll squeeze one in on Thursday and we’ll do the bulk on Saturday. Most buildings latest tours are 5pm or before. I’ll let you know when they’re all scheduled",,,,,
Lead,"Okay sounds good, thank you!",,,,,
Agent,Of course!,,,,,
Lead,"Good morning! I actually change my mind and not interested in the Rice anymore, it looks too dark there and don’t want to waste our time viewing it",,,,,
Agent,"Good morning! Okay cool, no biggie. It definitely does have a dark vibe throughout lol. Thanks for the update",,,,,
Agent,"Here’s the schedule, let me know if you have any questions!

Lead,Shronda White,,,,,
Lead,Hey! Do you remember if the apartment had a dish washer?,,,,,
Agent,Yeah they do,,,,,
Lead,"Okay, I’m still waiting for the quote",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, give her until eod and check spam",,,,,
Lead,Okay,,,,,
Agent,Hey! I’m not going to make it 😕 Next time!,,,,,
Lead,It’s okay,,,,,
Lead,Do you think we can tour the Rosslyn one more time Saturday after the other ones? I just want to make sure before I make a decision,,,,,
Agent,"They’re all booked this weekend. They have Tomorrow (10:30, 12, 1:30, 3). Any of those work?",,,,,
Lead,I can go on my lunch break tomorrow at 12. I just want to make sure since I would have to sign up Saturday if I want the rate,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, yea definitely understand. I’ll schedule for tomorrow at 12",,,,,
Lead,Thank you again!,,,,,
Agent,Of course! It’s set for tomorrow at 12. I’m can’t make this one but let me know your thoughts the 2nd time around!,,,,,
Lead,Okay will do!,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Okay will do! ”,,,,,
Agent,What’s the word after a 2nd time?,,,,,
Lead,"I’m still waiting on the quote, she said there’l system been down but I just want to see if it will be more for a 15 months lease instead of 12 but I really like the place and the drive from there to work was ehhh lol it was okay for that price but still want to see the rest tomorrow before I make the final decision",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, lol for the price you gotta get up a little earlier. Got you, I’ll meet you tomorrow at The Travis but I have to leave after so you’ll do Modera Washington without me. And Modera Garden Oaks, it’s about the same distance from work for you as Rosslyn, it’s brand new and it’s even cheaper than Rosslyn. You let me know if you want to cancel or keep it just to see, you never know.",,,,,
Lead,I’ll keep it just to see it and okay that’s fine,,,,,
Agent,Loved “I’ll keep it just to see it and okay that’s fine ”,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning, my car didn’t start this morning 😕 so I’m not going to be able to make it to Travis either. You’re going to be on your own today but let me know how everything goes",,,,,
Lead,"Good morning and it’s okay, I’ll keep you posted and I hope everything works out with your car",,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Good morning and it’s okay, I’ll keep you posted a…”",,,,,
Agent,Okay sounds good. And thank you!,,,,,
Lead,Travis said I need a locator here to do the tour,,,,,
Agent,"Hey, did they let you tour? They require me to be there to get credit but you should’ve been fine to tour. I didn’t want the tour to get held up because of me",,,,,
Lead,They said I could not tour because you weren’t there so I left. The Modera Washington wasn’t good just modera garden oaks was the best and I’m going with them.,,,,,
Agent,"That’s crazy, i’m sorry you couldn’t see them. Glad you liked Modera Garden Oaks though. You must’ve loved them to choose them over Rosslyn!",,,,,
Agent,You have everything you need from them to apply?,,,,,
Lead,I applied with them and yea the crowd there is more my age and I loved the decor and how the building is,,,,,
Lead,Did you put anything in the system to make sure you were listed? I’ll email them once I hear back about my application,,,,,
Agent,"Okay great. Yea I sent your guest card before hand, but was there anywhere to list “locator” as your referral on the app?",,,,,
Lead,No there wasn’t and that application gave me anxiety with the timer. I was applying for one apartment and someone submitted an application for the same one but they had the same floor plan next door so I was able to still get it but it’s not white cabinets but it’s okay because they had a den,,,,,
Agent,Lol you’re not the first to tell me that. Nice! You got one with the den. That’s perfect. Happy with your final decision?,,,,,
Lead,Yes I was able to hang with the residence when I was applying and they were cool. It looks like a lot of black people my age,,,,,
Agent,That’s dope. I’m happy we found the right place,,,,,
Agent,"I’ll need a few details so I can invoice the property correctly. Can you send these when you get them please
 
 Unit:
 Base Rent:
 Move date:
 Lease term:
 
 Also, they might give you a locator addendum at your move in. Please make sure you add my info to link me as your referral, here’s any info you’ll need…

Agent,"For real, thanks for working with me again Elyshia, I really appreciate you trusting me. If you need me for anything during the approval process just let me know!",,,,,
Lead,,IMG_7211.jpeg,,,,
Lead,This is what they sent me and she said she will change the move in date manually to 9/1/24,,,,,
Lead,18 months,,,,,
Agent,"Perfect, thanks!",,,,,
Lead,You’re welcome! I gotta be the easiest client 🤣🤣🤣,,,,,
Agent,"Lol well if I’m being honest, repeat clients are always the easiest. You already know me. But you do give little issues lol 💆🏽‍♂️",,,,,
Lead,Lol what issues?,,,,,
Agent,Little issues lol as in none,,,,,
Lead,Ooo lol okay. Thank you again though,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Ooo lol okay. Thank you again though ”,,,,,
Agent,Of course. And thank you again,,,,,
Lead,You’re welcome!,,,,,
Agent,…You think Mark would want to move into Modera too? It’s within his budget,,,,,
Lead,Yea I sent him the videos and told him about it so just waiting for him to text back,,,,,
Agent,"Okay cool, what’s his last name and email?",,,,,
Lead,Hey! I haven’t heard from him. I sent the videos and asked if he likes it but he’s been MIA,,,,,
Agent,Okay! When/ if you do can you send it? I just want to send a guest card to Modera incase he leases there. I have a feeling he might,,,,,
Lead,"I will, I know he’s not going to like that it’s an electric stove because that bothers me but I can get over it",,,,,
Agent,Mmm I recently made that switch too lol definitely understand that. If you hear from him lmk. I figure if he’s not answering you he damn sure won’t answer me,,,,,
Lead,Lol I will,,,,,
Agent,Lol ok thanks,,,,,
Lead,You’re welcome,,,,,
Lead,"Happy New Year! Hope all is well! I have a mutual friend that’s moving here and needs help looking for a pet friendly, safe area apartment. Are you able to assist her? She will be here next week to look at places",,,,,
Agent,"Happy New Year! Of course, I’m happy to help. Thanks for the referral. Just have her text me!",,,,,
Lead,You’re welcome and will do!,,,,,
Agent,Loved “You’re welcome and will do!”,,,,,
Lead,"Good evening! Hope all is well! My lease ends in February and I want to start a new lease 2/1 so that means I would need to lock in another place the end of December. Are you able to help me find a townhouse (3 bedroom minimum and 2 bathroom minimum). I want to stay in this zip code 77025. And the budget would be no more than $2,200",,,,,
Agent,"Morning Elyshia! Thanks, I hope the same. I’m not quite sure I can find a 3 bed townhouse inside the loop under $2200 and in such a specific zip code. Do you have any flexibility in what you’re looking for?",,,,,
Lead,What flexibility do you need to find it?,,,,,
Agent,A good budget for townhome inside the loop is about $2500 minimum. $2200 can be doable but outside of the loop,,,,,
Lead,It has to be that area code. What about a two bedroom?,,,,,
Agent,"Apartments, yes. But not townhomes in that price and zipcode. But even apartments in that specific zip code I don’t think you’ll like. There are some in neighboring zip codes but that specific zip code is pretty weak for newer builds if I’m being honest. You couldn’t be even one zip code away?",,,,,
Lead,My boyfriend wants to be close to his dad for health reasons so that’s why I wanted that zip code. I’ll compromise on the new build but it has to look update at least. I’ll even consider one zip code away depending how far it is from his dads house,,,,,
Agent,Okay. Do you want to share the address and max distance you want to be?,,,,,
Lead,Let me find the address,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Let me find the address ”,,,,,
Lead,"I can’t find the address and waiting for him to send it but if you can find one near the target that’s at this address we can work with that
 
 8500 S Main St, Houston, TX",,,,,
Lead,"He said it can be area code 77035, 77045, 77054 or pearland",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I just emailed you some options to your Gmail. Check spam if you don’t see it. 
 
 Keep in mind availability for February won’t be showing yet. I added those ZIP Codes plus Pearland and surrounding ZIP Codes. 
 
 Let me know if you plan to start touring soon or we are going to wait for February availability to show 👍🏼",,,,,
Lead,We might need to wait for the February availability to show because I won’t tour until December since they only hold apartments for 60 days,,,,,
Agent,Okay sounds good. Still take a look and let me know your thoughts on the places I sent so I can know what to be on the lookout for,,,,,
Lead,I’m looking now. There’s no 3 bedrooms for around that price either?,,,,,
Agent,"I added 3 bedrooms at Espria, Lenox sienna, and 1879 at the grid. Those are more toward Missouri city though. 3 bedrooms go the fastest usually at any apartment and price point will still be difficult to find if generally close to the inner-loop. Espria is closest of the 3 though and built just a few years ago",,,,,
Lead,Okay thank you! I’m a take a look,,,,,
Agent,Of course! Sounds perfect,,,,,

Lead,"Hey good afternoon. This is Ifueko. I have a new number. Not sure if you would remember me but you were helping me and my friend over the summer looking for a new place and my friend actually moved into an apt you helped her find. Well now I am looking for a new place again. If so my move in date is preferably Feb 28th or March 1st. I am looking for a studio, 1 bedroom and if there’s a good deal I’m open to a 2 bedroom. My price maximum is $1700. I can move sooner if there are any move in specials like first month free etc as well. I’m looking for more modern, w/d, garage needed. Are you able to help me find a place again?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Ifueko, of course I remember you. I actually just checked up on Kandisse the other day. I’d be happy to help. 
 
 And okay got it. What areas/neighborhoods are you considering?",,,,,
Lead,"Heights, Montrose, Upper Kirby, Medical Center, or Bellaire",,,,,
Lead,And Kandisse said she’s loving her place 😁 She didn’t get the text because she changed her number last month,,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Heights, Montrose, Upper Kirby, Medical Center, or Bellaire”",,,,,
Agent,"Yea the message showed up green lol. That’s perfect though, I’m really happy to hear that. I’ll send you some options today 👌🏼",,,,,
Lead,Ok thank you!,,,,,
Agent,"Of course! Just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Lead,Ok looking at them now!,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Ok looking at them now!”,,,,,
Lead,,Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 2.43.09 PM.jpeg,,,,
Lead,I’m liking this shower and tub separate for the bathroom at The Oliver. Is that for the one bedroom or the 2bedroom? To be honest I would love if I could find something like that in either a one bedroom or two bedroom. With a garage and w/d and a gym,,,,,
Lead,https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTYEqsWHD/,,,,,
Lead,I love the shower and bath combo like this,,,,,
Lead,The ones that I hearted I’m able to look at on Saturdays/Sundays whenever you get the availability to tour from them.,,,,,
Agent,Okay got it! I’ll verify which have the tub/shower combo and see if there are any others I can add. For now I’ll get the ones you “❤️’d” scheduled for this upcoming weekend,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Okay got it! I’ll verify which have the tub/shower…”,,,,,
Lead,Ok!,,,,,
Agent,Hey! What did you like most about your favorites? There are a bunch in there that I’m surprised you didn’t choose and want to direct you better.,,,,,
Lead,"To be honest, I think it’s the location for the one in the med center and the bathroom for the Oliver and the other two I have never toured so I wanted to see those. I’ve seen mostly the other ones you have sent. Do you think there are some in there that you have sent that I should reconsider? I’ll tour them again if you think they are better and maybe looking at them again may change my mind",,,,,
Agent,"Okay got it. Many of them actually. Some are brand new so only have a few residents like Artistry Design District, Emeline Heights, Alta Sunset Heights, and Rye Heights. 
 
 Pearl Rosemont is a really nice building and Highrise. East Bend is nice and across the street from M-K-T shopping mall. And other buildings scattered, many not in the specific neighborhoods you want. I saw you had the 2 bedroom at Vibe med center favorited for right under $2000. If you’re willing to increase budget for a 2 bedroom, Rosslyn garden oaks and Modera garden oaks have two bedrooms for about the same price. Just things to consider!",,,,,
Lead,Good morning! I updated and put hearts on apts I’m interested in!,,,,,
Lead,I think it’s about 9 now. I added the ones you mentioned above.,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good! I’ll get them scheduled,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Sounds good! I’ll get them scheduled ”,,,,,
Agent,Emeline is currently only doing hard hat tours Tuesdays & Thursday 10am-1pm. They’re that new. Let me know if there’s a time that works for you,,,,,
Lead,I can do Tuesday or Thursday at 12:15pm during my lunch break. I would leave work and get there by 12:15pm and then head back to work by 1245pm. My lunch is over at 1pm.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll try to get you scheduled for this Thursday",,,,,
Lead,"Liked “Okay, I’ll try to get you scheduled for this Thurs…”",,,,,
Lead,Hey good morning. Can we cancel The Oliver. It’s literally across the street from my job and I don’t want to be that close to my job lol but beautiful place but that’s tooooo close,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning ☀️ yea for sure lol I’ll cancel. 
 
 You’re scheduled for Emeline Heights tomorrow at 12:15pm 👍🏽
 
 All the others are scheduled for Sat and Sun except for one. I’ll send the full schedule when they’re all confirmed!",,,,,
Lead,"Loved “Good morning ☀️ yea for sure lol I’ll cancel. 
 
 Yo…”",,,,,
Lead,Ok!,,,,,
Lead,https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2JN7rNf/,,,,,
Lead,Where is this?,,,,,
Agent,That’s Artistry Design District. You’re going there Saturday,,,,,
Lead,Loved “That’s Artistry Design District. You’re going ther…”,,,,,
Lead,Headed there now to Emeline,,,,,
Lead,12min away,,,,,
Agent,Okay perfect. I won’t be there but let me know how it goes!,,,,,
Lead,Ohhh ok. I’ll let you know what I think!,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Ohhh ok. I’ll let you know what I think!”,,,,,
Lead,I think Emeline is nice and I would consider it,,,,,
Agent,Niceee. Starting off on the right foot,,,,,
Lead,Emphasized “Niceee. Starting off on the right foot”,,,,,
Lead,The only thing is I want a garage,,,,,
Agent,You mean like a private 1 car garage?,,,,,
Lead,Yes,,,,,
Lead,You know how some places have garages you can rent out for an extra fee a month,,,,,
Agent,"Yes, truthfully you don’t see those too often in the city, especially with new builds. City apartments are built up so you see stacked garages while apartments on the outskirts are built wide so you see gated parking with those rentable garage options. Is there a specific reason or are you kind of thinking about car security?",,,,,
Lead,I want to park my car in a garage since I just bought a new car and don’t want it all scratched up lol,,,,,
Agent,"Lol I think the best route would be to pay for a designated spot. That’s the option you typically might have with stacked garage parking. Private garages, not so much unfortunately 😕…not in the areas you want to live",,,,,
Lead,Liked “Lol I think the best route would be to pay for a d…”,,,,,
Lead,Is there an area you would suggest living in outside of the areas I said I wanted to that would have a garage?,,,,,
Agent,Check the location of Remy on the Trails and Rowan on the Trails and see if those are too far. That’s like Briarforest area,,,,,
Agent,You also should have some in Spring Branch area,,,,,
Lead,Spring Branch seems like an ok location,,,,,
Lead,You can send over what you find from those areas. I don’t think those areas spring branch or briarforest are too far at all,,,,,
Agent,"Ok, I updated your list. You can see them all by clicking on any apartment from the original email I sent. Here’s what I added…
 
 Remy on the trails 
 Rowan on the trails 
 Alora Bear Creek 
 Avasa spring branch 
 The Westover at West branch 
 
 These all have detached garages. Based on what you want to tour, I’ll just need to make sure they have garages available.",,,,,
Lead,You’re fast!,,,,,
Lead,Love it,,,,,
Lead,"Liked “Ok, I updated your list. You can see them all by c…”",,,,,
Agent,😌,,,,,
Lead,I would like to tour remy on the trails,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, while we’re there do you want to see the studios at Rowan on the trails? Slightly newer and they’re right across the street",,,,,
Lead,Yes since it’s right across the street. Wouldn’t hurt,,,,,
Lead,Thank you for getting all of these scheduled so quickly too,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good. Of course. Remy is scheduled for Sunday I’ll let you know when Rowan is confirmed and send the full weekend schedule after,,,,,
Lead,Ok!,,,,,
Lead,Do you have an apt that has a good view of Houston skyline?,,,,,
Lead,Wishful thinking lol. Wondering if you could send over places that you think would fit that even if it’s not in the areas I requested or doesn’t have a garage of course and isn’t brand new?,,,,,
Lead,Gm too!,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning! Your best options would be Elev8, Pearl Rosemont, Forth at Navigation, Bowen River Oaks, Brava, Drewery place, 1810 Main, the Travis, and Catalyst",,,,,
Agent,They’ll have studios or 1 beds under or around $1700 and are Highrises,,,,,
Lead,"Ok once we look at the apts you have set up for this weekend, I’m sure I’ll like two or three of those for sure but then we can set up these that you just mentioned to tour some high rises and then I’ll be able to make a decision",,,,,
Lead,Can you send over links to these so I can view them?,,,,,
Agent,"For sure, just added them they’re all on your list",,,,,
Lead,Ok I’ll check in a few,,,,,
Lead,Does the Catalyst and the Travis have availability? Asking because it’s not showing any studios or 1 bed available? I would like to tour those as well if they have availability,,,,,
Lead,"Ok so I put stars by Elev8, Fourth at Navigation(which I remembering touring with you but want to see again), and Brava",,,,,
Agent,"Yes they both do. Best price for studio at Catalyst is $1710. Studios at The Travis start at $1550
 
 Sounds good. Do you want to fill in this weekends gaps with these?",,,,,
Lead,"Yes can you get these scheduled too. Elev8, Fourth at Navigation, Brava, The Caralyst, The Travis, Drewery Place, The Rye, and Bowen River Oaks. I wasn’t sure if those were on the list of tours because I didn’t see those on the list under tours",,,,,
Lead,Not sure if you can do them all in one weekend but I know once I look at the other places I would only have like the 48-72 hour window to get the specials right which is why I don’t mind touring all of them in one weekend if that’s even possible or realistic lol 😩,,,,,
Agent,"Nah you’ll get the specials lol. They just say that but whatever we decide, I’ll have the apt verify you’ll get the special via email before you apply. It might be best to leave most of these to next weekend",,,,,
Lead,Loved “Nah you’ll get the specials lol. They just say tha…”,,,,,
Lead,Ohhh ok. That’s way better than to leave the rest for next weekend!,,,,,
Lead,That would have been too many to view and overwhelming lol,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Ohhh ok. That’s way better than to leave the rest for next weekend!”,,,,,
Agent,Lol I agree,,,,,
Lead,Im getting excited. Hopeful that my new place will be one of these that we tour this weekend/next weekend 🤞🏽🙏🏽,,,,,
Agent,I’m excited too! I think it will be!,,,,,
Lead,I never got the schedule,,,,,

Lead,"Loved “Sorry! Long day. Here it goes…
 
 Saturday, January …”",,,,,
Lead,Ok we don’t have to see that one then. See you tomorrow @10am,,,,,
Agent,Liked “Ok we don’t have to see that one then. See you tomorrow @10am”,,,,,

Lead,Perfect. Ok I’m here. I’ll wait for you.,,,,,
Agent,Ok,,,,,
Lead,Heyyy. Soo so far I like The Rye and The Artistry Design District.,,,,,
Agent,"Nicee. Okay cool, you’ll have a tough decision once we’re done touring",,,,,
Lead,"Emphasized “Nicee. Okay cool, you’ll have a tough decision onc…”",,,,,

Lead,"But after driving the area there, I wouldn’t want to live over there",,,,,
Lead,But I liked Rowan on the trails today,,,,,
Lead,"Can you get these scheduled for next weekend? Elev8, Fourth at Navigation, Brava, The Catalyst, The Travis, Drewery Place, and Bowen River Oaks.",,,,,
Agent,"Wow, I’m so sorry. Idk why they let me schedule that tour. 
 
 Okay, yea for sure I’ll have them scheduled 👌🏽",,,,,
Lead,Ok no problem and thank you!,,,,,
Agent,My pleasure,,,,,
Lead,Hey good morning. My job is trying to get us to come into work Saturday instead since we’ll be closed tomorrow because of the weather. They are thinking 9am-2pm. I can tell them 9-12pm instead for me if you think it’ll be better as far as being able to look those apts starting like 1230 and on instead of 230 and on. What do you think?,,,,,
Agent,Good morning. Yes let’s try to start at 12:30. We’ll be able to get to more,,,,,
Lead,Ok I’ll tell them I can work from 9-12,,,,,
Agent,Okay sounds good. I’ll let you know the schedule soon,,,,,
Lead,Ok!,,,,,
Agent,"Hey, Bowen River Oaks is fully booked this weekend. Would you want to go on your lunch break this Thursday, say 12:30?",,,,,
Lead,Could you book it for Friday anytime after 3pm? I’m off early on Fridays. Going on my lunch break on Thursday might be pushing it and I’ll be late back from lunch.,,,,,
Agent,There’s only 11:30-12:30 Friday. There’s times available up to 5pm next week and next week Friday too,,,,,
Lead,Do they have 12:15 on Thursday?,,,,,

Lead,,Audio Message.m4a,,,,
Agent,Okay 😕 let me know when is best to reschedule. If you want to do a weekend we can schedule for next weekend,,,,,
Lead,What time do they stop doing tours during the week?,,,,,
Agent,Last tour is 5pm during the week,,,,,
Lead,Do they have anything for tomorrow? I’m off work at 3pm,,,,,
Agent,"No, I’m sorry. They’re booked until Tuesday",,,,,
Lead,Ohh you did say that. Next Friday anytime after 3pm,,,,,
Lead,Or next weekend,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, scheduled for Friday, Jan 31st @4pm",,,,,
Lead,Ok thank you,,,,,
Agent,Of course,,,,,
Lead,So far I’m in love with Elev8,,,,,
Lead,Heading to the last two and I’ll let you know what I think,,,,,
Agent,Loved “So far I’m in love with Elev8”,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good!,,,,,
Lead,"So far I’m liking Artistry Design District, The Rye, and Elev8",,,,,
Lead,Rowan on the Trails is cool too,,,,,
Agent,Okay perfect. Sorry for the late text. We just have Bowen left. Those are some really good options to choose between,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Okay perfect. Sorry for the late text. We just have Bowen left. Those are some really good options to choose between”,,,,,
Lead,I agree!,,,,,
Agent,Loved “I agree!”,,,,,
Lead,"I think I’m going to do the application for Elev8 tommorow or by Monday just to make sure I don’t lose it 😩 On top of the 4-6weeks free, she also added on a $500 gift card ☺️ that was the icing on the cake being that I was already in love with it.",,,,,
Lead,But I’m going to look at the apts tomorrow that are scheduled and Bowen on Friday still.,,,,,
Agent,"Oh right, I completely blanked. I forgot you have Drewery Place and Forth at Navigation tomorrow. Which floor plan are you going after at Elev8?",,,,,
Lead,"It was a studio and then I’m looking at the 1bedroom. I looked at so many so far, I can’t remember which floor plan but I’ll send the video. I have the sheet in my car and can send it to you tomorrow.",,,,,
Lead,,IMG_4262.mov,,,,
Lead,,IMG_4264.mov,,,,
Lead,,IMG_4266.MOV,,,,
Lead,�,,,,,
Lead,The apt numbers are 516 or 1406,,,,,
Agent,"Depends on if you want the true studio or the studio with separate bedroom. 1406 is an S3 (separate room). There are 2 available, same price. 
 516 is an S2, and one room without the separation. Only one of these at the price point so applying wouldn’t be a bad idea. How sure are you that Elev8 is what you want?",,,,,
Agent,Let me know how everything went when you get a chance,,,,,
Lead,"Heyy ok. Everything went good today.
 I still am liking Elev8 the most",,,,,
Lead,After would be Artistry Design District,,,,,
Lead,Is there anything else you would want me to look at besides Bowen on Friday or is that everything you would have to show?,,,,,
Agent,"Okay perfect. No, Bowen would be the last. I think we’ve seen the best. And I don’t think Bowen compares to Elev8 at all, being honest. Now that you’ve seen those today I’d even say you can make a decision and still see Bowen to see it but I’m 99.9% sure they won’t be your choice",,,,,

Agent,"Hi Ellie! its Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form to let us help with finding your next apartment! I’ll send all the best deals and specials for your move date, I just need to clarify a few things from your form submission! 
 
 Is your move date flexible or do you have a lease ending on a specific day?",,,,,
Lead,"It is flexible, I just want to sign a lease before August",,,,,
Lead,Ideally July,,,,,
Agent,"Okay got it, will you be relocating to Houston or are you already living here?",,,,,
Lead,Relocating but I’m originally from Houston and know which areas I want to live in,,,,,
Agent,"Okay great, what areas?",,,,,
Lead,"I am looking in the greater heights and montrose areas, open to living in the medical district",,,,,
Agent,"Got it, your budget came in as $14,000 per month. Did you mean $1,400?",,,,,
Lead,"Yes 1,400.",,,,,
Agent,Perfect. Will you be visiting at any point to tour before applying? Or will the next time you’re in Houston be when you move in?,,,,,
Lead,"Yes, I would like to come tour the first few weeks of June",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, got it. Anything else at all that you want to share that could make the perfect apartment?",,,,,
Lead,"I need it to be pet friendly, I have a small 10 pound dog",,,,,
Agent,,Rental Requirements.PNG,,,,
Agent,"Got it. Lastly, these are the general requirements.
 
 What is your gross monthly income and estimated credit score? I ask to make sure I only send deals with the best chances of being approved",,,,,
Lead,"So I will be a full time law student, I do not have much credit but score is in the 700s, the only other lease I have signed before was co-signed with my parent which I can do again if needed, my current income is about 34K",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, got it. The units you can be approved for on your own will be essential housing (income restricted) units. And, understood on the cosign. I will send both options that are available!",,,,,
Agent,"We’ll be doing things a bit different since you’ll be coming in June. Usually I won’t send deals until clients are ready to tour but I’ll send options so you see what’s available. With the platform we have you can use it to run your own searches as well. 
 
 You’ll need another list before you tour though because what’s available now, won’t be available a few weeks from now. I’ll let you know if I think a deal is just too good to pass up so you have the opportunity to virtually tour and apply if you decide to!",,,,,
Lead,"Yes, if it is a very good deal I have family there that can assist with touring as well so I don’t miss a deal, but yes I just want to see the types of places I can consider with my budget",,,,,
Agent,"Perfect. I just emailed your list of options I handpicked based off of the criteria we discussed. 
 
 Extremely excited for you to see the options - I’m confident a winner is in there! 
 
 Can you review those for me please and let me know our top 3-5 you may either want your family to tour or for us to keep in mind for tours when you visit in a few weeks? Some do require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏼 
 
 I’ll check in Friday if I don’t hear from you before then! Can’t wait to see the top picks!

Lead,"From the list of suggestions, I’d be interested in touring art house sawyer yards, Pearl marketplace at midtown, prose hardy yards, the Vic at interpose and the standard in the heights.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay great, we can knock them all out in a day. What day works best for you this week?",,,,,
Lead,I cannot come down to Houston until next week and preferably would need to be Friday or Saturday,,,,,
Agent,No problem! I’ll have them scheduled for you for next weekend,,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Lead,Also do you mind sharing more information with me about the essential housing program?,,,,,
Agent,"No problem! Sure, with essential housing there is a strict income requirement that your gross monthly income must be AT or OVER 2.5x or 3x the monthly rent. But you also have to be UNDER a certain amount, which is usually around $39,720 per month. Income requirements are strict so you can’t be over or under by even $1
 
 Here’s an example of the essential housing rules. They are pretty similar across the board except some require you still make 3x the rent and others only require 2.5x. Based on income of $34,000/annually that means you make $2833.3/monthly which means at 2.5x the rent you can be approved for $1133/month. And at 3x the rent you can be approved for $944/month",,,,,
Agent,https://www.warehousedistrictapts.com/essential-housing,,,,,
Agent,Let me know if I’m making sense,,,,,
Lead,"Yes, that’s perfect thank you.",,,,,
Agent,"You’re very welcome. You’ll be getting emails when your tours are confirmed for next Saturday, June 8th",,,,,
Agent,"Let me know in the mean time if I can help any further. Same for instagram or TikTok. Send me anything you want info on if you see stuff on other peoples pages, that way you don’t need to fill out a bunch of forms",,,,,
Lead,,IMG_0668.PNG,,,,
Lead,It looks like this tour was set for the wrong date. The other emails I have received have been correct. Thank you again.,,,,,
Agent,"Thanks for the heads up, I’ll have it corrected!",,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, I am still wanting to tour the apartments this Saturday. However, I am still debating on living solo or with 1 roommate. Just out of curiosity would you be able to make me a list of apartment suggestions in the same areas I’m interested in and pet friendly but 2 beds and max budget $2400/month? I am very interested in prose hardy yards if they have units that fit that criteria.",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Ellie, sure thing. I’ll get back to you today",,,,,
Lead,Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Thank you! ”,,,,,

Agent,Sounds great Ellie! Happy to help you both find your new place!,,,,,
Agent,"Ellie, you mentioned that your combined budget will be $2400/mo. In order for yall to get approved at that amount you two combined will need to prove gross monthly income of $7200. 
 
 Is that doable? If not I’ll need to know both incomes to determine what we can qualify for",,,,,
Lead - Maddy Machlab,"Hi! 
 Yes, that is, as long as Ellie makes around 50k then we qualify. Combined our income should be around 100k gross yearly. 
 
 Also please keep in mind that utilities are going to be added with all of those expenses like the amenity fees and valet trash if the place offers it. I want it to be as close to the $1000-$1200 range as possible in a good area. It does not have to be directly in downtown max 15-20 min drive.",,,,,

Lead - Maddy Machlab,Maddy Machlab ⚡️ unsent a message.,,,,,
Agent,"Lol honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate. The move never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay a move deposit and sometimes you just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out 🤷‍♂️… just my thoughts based on what I’ve seen",,,,,
Lead - Maddy Machlab,"Okay perfect, then I’ll do that and use that rebate to cover expenses. Thank you for letting me know!!",,,,,

Lead - Maddy Machlab,"I saw you mentioned it’s payed out the same day you’re payed out, when would that typically be?",,,,,
Agent,"Hey! That’s perfect. The $200 was already entered. It’s per household so it will be y’all’s to split. Apartments typically pay us within 60-90 days of your move in date. And when they pay my firm, it is sent to you via Zelle before it even gets to me. It usually comes as a nice surprise, but if you need updates you can reach out to me. I get a few updates along the way before it’s actually paid out!",,,,,

Agent,Pleasure is mine. Sounds perfect!,,,,,
Agent,"Just emailed your list. Keep in mind it’s a starter list and in order for us to have success when touring you’ll want to determine some areas you want to live. I can help and talk through it with you so we can target specific areas when you’re here based on the lifestyle you’re looking for and places you might frequent. Just let me know any questions you have!
 
 Some apts require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling when we start squealing tours👍🏽
 
 Let me know your top 3-5 from your list and I’ll keep them on the radar to tour!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Lead,"Good afternoon ,Ashanti . 
 
 I received the starter list. 
 I was able to do a little more research on the areas I would like to stay in . 
 FYI, I’ll be working downtown so my goal is to not have a far commute to and from work . 
 
 “I’m looking for a modern apartment in a safe area close to downtown. My ideal unit would have floor-to-ceiling windows, ( regular windows are ok as well )a walk-in closet, and in-unit washer and dryer. I’d also love access to amenities like a swimming pool. With a balcony /patio. With a gym . Staying within my max of 1,300 monthly .Could you help me find places that meet these needs?”
 
 Here are the areas listed below if you can, please share insight on the areas .
 
 Rice military 
 Crestwood/Glen Cove 
 Washington Avenue 
 Memorial Drive 
 Washington Avenue Coalition/memorial park . 
 ❓ 
 
 Also, I didn’t know all the information that you just provided far as squealing tour . I scheduled tours on my own. At the following locations :
 
 1.Azure
 
 2.MAA Valleywood (the woodlands ) 
 which I now know is about 40 minutes from downtown .
 
 3.Birchway Perry Road 
 
 Please let me know if I should cancel the tours and allow you to reschedule.",,,,,
Lead,Loved “Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free …”,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Kimberly…Do you go by Kim or Kimberly? This is great info. A few things…
 
 We can get into a nice apartment but floor to ceiling windows within $1300 isn’t feasible (contrary to what instagram can lead to believe). Everything else is a go. Just keep in mind that you’ll have fees on top of base rent (Ex. Valet trash, pest control, sometimes an amenity fee) amounting to $35-75 or so. Plus you’ll be paying your water, electricity, renters insurance, and internet. 
 
 Azure - the only 1 bed I see in range is essential housing meaning it’s income restricted. For that unit you’ll need to make 3x the rent but make under $60,600 per year
 Azurehoustonapts.com/essential-housing/
 
 MAA Valleywood - I wouldn’t send you there. I really want to save you the headache of a drive to and from The Woodlands especially in traffic which could easily double your commute time. Plus these specifically were built in 1984. We can get way newer for the price, no need to see them (in my opinion)
 
 Birchway Perry Rd - 👍🏼 worth a tour as long as you’re okay with the commute
 
 No need to cancel tours, just let me know what day and time they’re scheduled and which of the 3 you’d still like to see based on the above info so I can communicate with the office and know for when we coordinate the others. 
 
 Also, let me know if you can be approved for essential housing which requires you make 3x rent but generally under about $60k per year. If so I’ll look for other options like them. Hope this helps!",,,,,
Agent,Oh and the locations you put they’re all somewhat the same location. I’ll try to get you as central and close to Downtown as I can,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Oh and the locations you put they’re all somewhat …”,,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti. Thanks for asking . Kimberly is fine , although I don’t have a problem with you calling me Kim 😊. 
 
 I knew the Wall to ceiling windows would definitely make you laugh reading that knowing the budget 😂 however the windows isn’t a big deal . 
 
 I did notice Azure was an income restriction property. I do meet the requirements for those properties . At this current moment I’m at 60k. 
 Thank you for that information. 
 
 I’m aware of the additional fees. 
 
 I’m not really too big to be like directly in the downtown area for example I live south Atlanta It typically takes me about 15 minutes to get to Work with no traffic. Let’s say about 20 to 30 with traffic . 
 
 I don’t mind commuting. I just don’t want be too far out .Houston traffic is almost 3 times worse than Atlanta traffic. 
 
 I really appreciate all of your efforts 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾",,,,,
Lead,"If I may, how far Birchwood is from the downtown area ?",,,,,
Agent,"Gotcha! Lol floor to ceiling is going to have to wait. 
 
 Perfect, good to know for budget. I’ll check for some other similar properties to add to the list in the next couple days. 
 
 I’ll check for areas keeping in mind distance to Downtown. You’ll definitely want to rule out The Woodlands if you want to be a reasonable commute to Downtown. 
 
 Birchway Perry Road is about 30 mins from downtown with no traffic",,,,,
Lead,"Good morning , Ashanti . I wanted to follow up with you to see if you updated the list . If so I’ll go back and check them out . Thank you . 🙏🏾",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Kimberly! Sorry I didn’t get back sooner. I just went in and updated the list to add options closer to central Houston. Prices will be higher in these areas but you can still pay under your price range when specials are included. 
 
 For example, rent at Alta Sunset Heights (Brand new building) is $1495 + 2 months free = $1265/month. This is how you’ll be closer to the city and still get the price you want. 
 
 For the record, with your income you can be approved for $1665 (just good info to know). 
 
 Let me know if you have any questions and if all is the same and you’ll be in town December 3rd let me know all of which apts you’ll want to see and I’ll have them scheduled! 😌",,,,,
Lead,"Good afternoon, Ashanti . 
 Thank you so much for this information. 
 
 I have placed a star ⭐️ on the properties I would love to view. 
 
 FYI, as mentioned before I do have three tours already set up and the times and dates are listed below:
 
 
 MAA Valleywood: Wednesday,December 4th at 10am
 
 AZURE:Wednesday ,December 4 at 12 PM 
 
 Bitchwood Perry Wood :
 Thursday, December 5 at 12 noon 
 
 Depending on how traffic is I may have to reschedule the MAA valley wood. 
  
 
 Please let me know your thoughts.",,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Good afternoon, Ashanti . 
 Thank you so much for t…”",,,,,
Agent,"Good afternoon Kimberly, absolutely!
 
 Sounds perfect, I’ll have the ⭐️’d apts all scheduled 
 
 My thoughts about MAA Valley wood is you’d be wasting your time. They’re so far from the city and really old apartments. If you want to check out an apartment at a similar price point I’d suggest Royal Spring with 1 beds at $975. Just my thoughts but obviously I encourage you to do what you feel is best. 
 
 With Azure, Birchway Perry Rd, and the others I’ll schedule, I think we have an amazing lineup to choose from. 
 
 I’ll get those scheduled this weekend. Are the 4th and 5th going to be your only touring days or will you have any time on the 3rd or 6th?",,,,,
Lead,"Loved “Good afternoon Kimberly, absolutely!
 
 Sounds perfe…”",,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti ,thank you for the update on the property. I trust your judgement so I’ll cancel the appointment. 🙏🏾

 You have been amazing throughout this whole entire process and I figured that this was something that they will be able to better assist with. 
 
 It was just more questions like ""will I be able to complete everything via online""
 
 ""Will concessions still be available once my projected move-in date"" things like that it wasn’t anything to major, but if I do bump into any questions or concerns pertaining to you and your service, I would definitely reach out to you.

Agent,"Hey Kimberly, thanks for reaching out! I’m sorry to hear you didn’t get the promotion you were hoping for. I know a Texas move isn’t far away for you though. It was really my pleasure to help. I’ll be here for you when it’s time! Take great care!",,,,,

,,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Mario, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form! I’m happy to help you find your next apartment and send all of the new buildings within your price range. 
 
 What areas are you considering? Any IG posts you need info for?",,,,,
Lead,I don’t really know the areas in Houston but I want to stay in a good environment that’s only like 20 minutes from downtown,,,,,
Agent,Got it. Do you have a lease ending soon or is your move date pretty open?,,,,,
Lead,My lease now ends February 22,,,,,
Lead,I’m going to be in Houston within the next couple weeks doing apt tours,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, sounds good. I have your budget at $1500. Is that flexible at all or a strict number?",,,,,
Lead,It’s flexible to go lower 😂,,,,,
Agent,"Lol got you. At $1500 rent per month. You’d need to show you gross monthly income is at least $4500 per month, are you good there?",,,,,
Lead,Can l use my bank statements?,,,,,
Agent,Yes,,,,,
Lead,"Okay cool, I’m an entrepreneur so my monthly income fluctuate but my bank statements should get me approve",,,,,
Agent,"Okay cool. Anything else you want to share about what you’re looking for that I should be aware of while I search? Specific amenities, square feet preferences, pet friendly, etc?",,,,,
Lead,"I prefer up to date appliances, a walk in closet, and also a parking garage for car.",,,,,
Lead,"I also heard Stafford Texas, and Sugarloaf not to far from the city. I don’t know if those are good areas but if you know any good apartments in that area can you put those on the list too",,,,,
Agent,Got it. I’ll send some options in a bit,,,,,
Lead,Okay,,,,,
Agent,"Just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up for when you’re in town.",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 I’m able to do that when you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Lead,"Okay cool, do any of these apartments offer first month rent free or any deals",,,,,
Agent,Yes many of them are running specials right now. This list is for your reference but prices and specials can change on a daily basis so to avoid getting attached to the price and specials you see today we should take note of what buildings you like and will want to tour. It’s possible prices and specials are different when you’re in town to tour so I’ll be updating your list right before you visit,,,,,
Lead,Reacted 😂 to “Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free …”,,,,,
Lead,Ok bet,,,,,
Lead,"So far I like 
 
 - Alta Sunset Heights 
 - Artistry design district 
 
 Can you send more?
 Some of those reviews on some communities don’t seem like the area is safe",,,,,
Agent,"Okay nice. Alta Sunset Heights is the best deal in Houston right now for price and location. It’s close to The Heights which has a lot of attractions (restaurants, stores, bars, etc). 
 
 I’d go as far as telling you you should applying since they’re doing a $99 application & admin to lock down the price. I can get video so you can , because there’s only one unit under $1500 right now and it’ll be gone for sure by the time you visit. 
 
 I sent the best within 20 mins of downtown and included Stafford and Sugarland. Which apts are you worried about the reviews?",,,,,
Lead,Hey I’m planning on being in Houston January 13-17 can you set me up some apartment tours?,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Mario, sounds good. For now is it only Alta Sunset Heights and Artisty design district you’re interested in?",,,,,
Lead,"Yes, I’m trying to take a couple more tours while out there than just those two tho. Atleast 4-5 tours. Need to look through a couple more apartments.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, I’ll take another look early this week and send you some options",,,,,
Lead,Okay thanks,,,,,
Agent,Of course,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Mario, I just updated your list with a few more options. These will be the best options under $1500. Some show prices above $1500 but monthly rent will be under when you factor in the special. 
 
 The best deal is Alta Sunset Heights in my opinion. It’s brand new and a handful of my clients have already leased there. You’ll love how central the location is too. 
 
 Let me know all buildings you want to tour and I’ll have them set up for when you visit. Let me know any questions you have also!",,,,,
Lead,How do I see the updated version? The list I see in the emails is the same,,,,,
Agent,Just click on one of the apartments and it will take you to the live favorites and recommendations,,,,,
Lead,Looking now,,,,,
Lead,On Alta sunset I see it’s $1495. I also see they have a 2 month 100% off rent on 12 month lease. Is that already included in the $1495 or will that take more money off,,,,,
Agent,That $1495 unit is already discounted so doesn’t receive the 2 months free. The others will,,,,,
Agent,"I see your favorites. I’ll have them scheduled for when you visit next week. 
 
 A few more that might be worth a look to stay under budget and be close to downtown are…
 
 10x 15th street flats
 Lumen
 The Flats at West Alabama
 
 Let me know if you want to add any of these 👍🏼",,,,,
Lead,Okay bet!,,,,,
Lead,I like 10x 15 street flags and the flags at west Alabama,,,,,
Agent,Okay cool! I’ll let you know when they’re all scheduled.,,,,,
Lead,Ok cool I land tomorrow,,,,,
Agent,Yup. What time will you be able to start touring? Or would you like to start Tuesday?,,,,,
Lead,I land at 10:30 so around 1,,,,,
Agent,Okay,,,,,
Agent,"Here’s your upcoming tour schedule:
 
 Monday, January 13 
 1:30 PM – flats at West Alabama 
 
 Tuesday, January 14 
 10 AM – 10X 15th Street flats 
 11 AM – Alta Sunset Heights 
 12 PM – Artistry Design District 
 
 Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Lead,Will I have time to make all those tours back to back Tuesday with travel time between each?,,,,,
Agent,Yes you’ll be fine. Tours are usually about 30 mins or less and these are close to one another,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning Mario ☀️ hoping you made it in safely! Good luck touring today, If you have any questions or concerns along the way just call or text me",,,,,
Lead,Okay cool,,,,,
Lead,"Liked “Good morning Mario ☀️ hoping you made it in safely! Good luck touring today, If you have any questions or concerns along the way just call or text me”",,,,,
Agent,I’ll be here if you need. Excited to hear how everything goes!,,,,,

Lead,Okay touring now,,,,,
Agent,Loved “Okay touring now”,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Mario, how were your tours? Which did you like best?",,,,,
Lead,Hey I liked the flats at Alabama and 10X 15th streets flats.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay perfect, do you have all you need to apply or do you still feel like you want to see other options?",,,,,
Lead,I want to see other options,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning. Okay, I’ll set you up for some tours today. Here’s what I suggest…
 
 Co/op Heights
 Lenox Oaks
 The Dacoma
 Lumen
 
 Let me know which you’d like me to schedule!",,,,,
Agent,How did tours go yesterday? Any in particular stand out?,,,,,

Agent,"Hey Britney! its Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment! Sorry you’re not feeling Dallas! Houston is definitely a better choice 🫢
 
 When next week will you be in Houston?",,,,,
Lead,Hello. I will be in Houston next Friday,,,,,
Lead,I’m also still narrowing areas,,,,,
Lead,Thanks for getting back with me,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, got it. And of course. Are there any important features or amenities you want to make sure your apartment building or specific unit has?",,,,,
Lead,"Well I am looking for a high rise. About 800 sq ft with Balcony. If you are familiar with the Atlanta area I lived in Buckhead so similar
 to that. I am particular about the fixtures lol. I would prefer a rather new building",,,,,
Agent,Okay. Got you on the fixtures lol👌🏼 and new building for sure. Is $2600 a strict budget or is there any flexibility?,,,,,
Lead,I would prefer to be between 2300-2600,,,,,
Lead,If the community is a couple of years (2) old that’s okay as well.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, just emailed your list
 
 Take a look and let me know which you want to tour next weekend. Some do require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👌🏽
 
 You’ll see a few properties Downtown and I know that wasn’t your preferred area but highly recommend seeing Parkside Residences, it’ll give you a different outlook on Downtown. Also September dates will be hard to come by until next month so we can always revisit
 
 Let me know if you have any questions! I’ll check in Monday if I don’t hear from you to see if I can help at all",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - it’s also the only way I’m paid for my free service, so thank you in advance for your referral! If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Lead,Thank you so much! I will take a look at the list. I know September dates will be up by next month but I want to take a look at the places so that I can narrow down.,,,,,
Agent,My pleasure! Sounds perfect,,,,,
Agent,Hey Britney! Checking in quick. Did you decide what properties you’ll be wanting to see this weekend?,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning Britney, I hope you traveled safely into Houston. Since my service is free to you, apartments require I communicate with them that you will be touring BEFORE you go, in order to credit me for your referral. 
 
 I’ve sent your guest card to the following properties. Please let me know which you will be visiting while you’re in town. Thanks a bunch!
 
 1. Aris Market Square

Agent,"Okay, we can tour when you’re back in Houston. And unfortunately not, they for one rarely have specials",,,,,
Lead,"Good morning, I am considering midrises. My first choice is a highrise but I would like a 2 bedroom and they were pricey in highrises. Do you know of any new mid rise apartments or even townhomes. Sorry I’m just looking at all options.",,,,,
Agent,"Good afternoon, sorry I’m traveling today. Yes I’ll send you some options over the weekend. Same budget between $2300-2600?",,,,,

Agent,Loved “Yes and thank you ”,,,,,

Lead,And some of the other options because I still want a special.,,,,,

Lead,Bowen also had bad reviews,,,,,

Lead,Sorry I’m all over the place I’m just super busy and I am picky 🤦🏽‍♀️ especially paying that much.,,,,,

Agent,Overall favorite for you I like Parkside Residences. With the special they have it’s a really good deal,,,,,
Agent,Let me know your thoughts once you get a chance to look at everything!,,,,,
Lead,I spoke to them and the special has changed to select units and they’re getting more residents. I also didn’t like there hallways and there isn’t much room to walk my dog.,,,,,

Agent,Just spoke to Brava. 1 moth free is for the A4 & A5. The A2 gets two weeks free. And the $1500 is a look and lease specials meaning applying within 48 hours of touring,,,,,
Agent,Did you ever tour Brava?,,,,,
Lead,I never toured with them,,,,,
Agent,"Okay. I can tour for you today and FaceTime you in order for you to get the extra $1500. There’s a 1pm available, does that work?",,,,,
Lead,I would have to apply in 48 hours right?,,,,,
Agent,Yes. Which if you’re interested in Brava I’d suggest even well before that so someone doesn’t scoop up the unit we’re after,,,,,
Lead,No special on A1?,,,,,
Lead,Nevermind,,,,,
Lead,It’s the timeframe,,,,,
Agent,You want to move in September right?,,,,,
Lead,October 1st ish,,,,,
Agent,Is Oct 25th too late?,,,,,
Lead,Yes,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, our options are to push the move date as late into September as possible and use the 2 week free special, since it’s given upfront so you don’t pay rent until about Oct 1st. 
 
 That. Or hope there’s still a unit available and a special around late September. Which I wouldn’t recommend",,,,,
Lead,Can they push it to October 1 move in?,,,,,
Lead,Or October 5 at latest,,,,,
Lead,I’m so sorry to be a pain,,,,,
Lead,Think I may skip them,,,,,
Lead,"It’s $1k just to apply. I will also have my sister on the lease as well, that’s a bit much at the time of applying.",,,,,
Agent,"It’s no pain, I want you to get what you want. As we push the date back, the price changes. 
 
 If you want an application fee of a few hundred we’ll need to look at other buildings. There aren’t many buildings as luxury as Brava though. There are a couple Hanovers, Parkside residences, Aspire, and a few more in the neighborhood of luxury. 
 
 Forth at Nav, very very nice but I wouldn’t say gives the same level of luxury",,,,,

Agent,"Hey no worries. Okay, I hope everything is alright. Do you have a date in mind that you want to be moved by yet?",,,,,
Lead,Not sure everything is in the air right now,,,,,

Agent,"Good evening Marcus, it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment! Just a couple questions so I know exactly what you’re looking for…
 
 I see you want a central location. Are you wanting pretty much anywhere inside the 610 loop?",,,,,
Lead,Preferably somewhere on the northern end or at least easily be able to get up north as that’s where I work,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, what date are you looking to move from your house?",,,,,
Lead,Preferably sooner than later but in the middle of the selling process,,,,,
Agent,"Got it, what days of the week work best for you for apartment tours?",,,,,
Lead,Weekends and evenings after 5 any day except Tuesdays,,,,,
Agent,Got it! I’ll send some options in the morning and we can start touring this weekend,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Got it! I’ll send some options in the morning and …”,,,,,
Agent,"Good afternoon, I just emailed your list
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 My favorites are Modera Garden Oaks and Rosslyn Garden Oaks for you. Both central but just north of the loop so will be easy to get work for you. Within budget and Modera within budget you can have a den to serve as a second room too. 
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Marcus, which options did you decide you’d like to tour in person?",,,,,
Lead,Hey I did I apologise things have been hectic since work started back but I really like Modera Garden Oak,,,,,
Agent,"No worries, that’s excellent. I’d like to get you in as soon as possible to tour. Does Thursday at 5:30pm work for you?",,,,,
Lead,That works,,,,,
Agent,"Perfect, we’re all scheduled for Modera Garden Oaks on Thursday @5:30pm
 
 Let me know if you have any questions!",,,,,
Lead,Do you have a few more opens in that are similar?,,,,,
Agent,I think the Rosslyn at Garden Oaks is worth a look too. These two are both new and will be most ideal with you working north,,,,,
Lead,I liked them but I did see a lot of break ins as far as cars,,,,,
Lead,I’m actually really close to Modera right now at a training would I be able to view them in the next 20 mins,,,,,
Agent,Definitely ask the leasing agent what they’re doing to make sure that doesn’t continue. You can definitely try touring today. They may be able to take you as a walk in depending on how swamped they are,,,,,
Agent,"Good morning, did you get a chance to swing by yesterday? Did they allow you to tour?",,,,,
Lead,"Yes they did allow me to tour, Rosslyn, they were ok but not the biggest bang for the buck. Underwhelming in comparison to the other choice",,,,,
Agent,"Okay perfect, yes I’d agree, still great you got a chance to compare. Anything Modera was lacking that you wish it had or do you think you’ll be going with them?",,,,,
Lead,I never seen Modera only images,,,,,
Agent,"Oh oh I see. I thought they were who you stopped by first yesterday. Well I think as far as space for price, you get a lot at Modera. 
 
 So Thursday at 5:30pm @ Modera is still on then?",,,,,
Lead,Yes,,,,,
Agent,Liked “Yes”,,,,,

Agent,"Morning brother, one thing I didn’t mention is if or when you decide to apply, there will be a referral section to add me as your locator. Please choose “realtor/locator” on the application when asked for your referral or how you found out about the property. 
 
 That’s the one way I’m paid by them for my free service. Keep me updated on what you decide. I’ll be here to help however I can",,,,,
Lead,Oh im already knowing I got you and I appreciate your business,,,,,
Agent,Thanks a lot and thanks for working with me 🤝,,,,,
Agent,"What’s up Marcus, just wanted to check on how everything is moving. Is Modera still the front runner when you decide to apply?",,,,,

Lead,Bet. Not to be rude but things seem to be moving fast so the sooner the better,,,,,
Agent,All good. I got a full day today but I’ll send some options tonight,,,,,
Lead,Ok thanks. The first choice is Madera. Would they still have the special with out rent around 17,,,,,
Agent,Absolutely. Okay sounds good. Yes they’re 6 weeks free right now,,,,,
Agent,"Here go a few to consider. Because of the space, price, and location they’re good deals. 
 
 Broadstone Amelia: Brand new building. Note no balconies
 
 The Travis: Highrise - 833 sqft | $1761
 
 Modera will have that 897 sqft unit you liked for $1915 + 6 weeks free = $1694/month",,,,,

Lead,How much was the two bedroom?,,,,,
Lead,With the special,,,,,
Agent,Lowest price 2 bed is $1845 + 6 weeks free = $1632/month,,,,,
Lead,May want to go with that one,,,,,
Lead,Why is that cheaper than the one lol?,,,,,
Agent,Lol I think it’s because of the layout. The one bed you get that den too so you have a second room and the living space is bigger,,,,,
Lead,I’d rather have the second room for cheaper,,,,,
Agent,Liked “I’d rather have the second room for cheaper”,,,,,
Agent,Just make sure you see both. I won’t be on tour with you but already sent your guest card to them,,,,,

Agent,Okay perfect. Thanks 🙏🏼 and yes that’s correct,,,,,
Agent,"If no trouble, give me a quick update when they get back to you with a decision",,,,,
Lead,Ok if they don’t come back can I get another list with some great places with a little bit lower of rent,,,,,
Agent,For sure,,,,,
Lead,Hey let’s go ahead and run that search because Modera may not work out,,,,,
Agent,Okay. Is it a problem getting approved with them or what’s the main issue?,,,,,
Lead,No the unit I wanted they said is wheel chair and the other units they have the rent increases to 1945,,,,,
Agent,Liked “No the unit I wanted they said is wheel chair and …”,,,,,
Agent,Which floorplan was it?,,,,,
Agent,…And I’ll get started. What’s max price you want to be under after specials and amount of space/number of rooms,,,,,
Lead,1750,,,,,
Agent,?,,,,,
Lead,What?,,,,,
Agent,"What floor plan were you after at Modera? And what size apartment?
 
 I know you wanted the two bed at Modera but we’re open to one bed when we started the search",,,,,
Lead,One bedroom with space is the biggest thing but what sold me was that the two bed room fell in range,,,,,
Lead,I’m coming from a 4bdr house just want to have something not to small just decent without the price of a house,,,,,

Lead,"Hi Shani, I’m Jaylah and I was referred to by Asiah because she said you were a super helpful and responsive locator which I really need right now. 
 
 I’m looking for a 2 bed/ 2 bath with a max budget of 2000 per month. I have an urgent move in date of 12/20/24 (yeah I know it’s been a terrible terrible journey this far). 
 
 My partner and I are open to areas but we really just want a nice/ newer complex that gives us the most bang for our buck. I work from home but he commutes to work in the 77020 zipcode so he wants something that is a fair commute to him (less than 50min drive from that area). We were looking into Houston Heights, parts of Katy that are closer to the loop, Midtown, Memorial heights, etc. 
 
 We currently reside in the North side of Houston and are hoping to move closer to the loop. We really really need your help right now. 
 This is the best number to reach me and my email is jaylahsymone09@gmail.com",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Jaylah, thanks for reaching out. I’d be happy to help!
 
 Understood on everything. I’ll send you some options shortly and we can start to schedule tours. 
 
 What is your last name?",,,,,
Lead,Thank you so much. Jaylah Humphrey is my full name,,,,,

 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Only sent a few, but they’re the best buildings in budget and they’re all running specials. 
 
 Let me know which you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 I’m able to do that when you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start any application and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Lead,"Hi, thanks for sending those over. I am the most interested in touring Alta Sunset Heights and to look into their specials. What’s the soonest that we could set up a tour here? It would have to be after 4pm on Weekdays or preferably this Saturday 12/14 morning or early afternoon.",,,,,
Agent,Absolutely. You could tour as soon as tomorrow. Weekday tours go as late as 5:30pm. But I can get you scheduled for this Saturday. Does 10am work?,,,,,

Agent,"Good morning! No worries, I rescheduled you for Saturday at 10am 👍🏽",,,,,

Lead,"This one here please, I’d like to view this weekend please",,,,,
Lead,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DA_eud9SCMx/?igsh=cjk1Zjk2MXZhdTJk,,,,,
Agent,This one is called Evolve Champions. Newly built and running 1 month free on top of prices you’ll see online.,,,,,
Agent,Best practice is for me to understand what you’re looking for and find exactly that! Do have a lease ending soon or is your move date open and flexible?,,,,,
Lead,"Lease ends December 31, or towards the end of December. 
 
 I like to move north or north west Houston 
 
 Under 1k for rent. I’m not super picky. If this one is as nice as the pictures and has decent guest parking, with water and electricity separate from other residents, I’ll sign this weekend",,,,,
Agent,Got it. At that price you may be able to qualify for essential housing which are lower priced units at new buildings. What is your gross monthly income?,,,,,
Lead,5k monthly,,,,,
Agent,Okay. How do you feel about space? Do you need a certain amount of square feet?,,,,,
Lead,"I prefer the smaller apartments, I’ll go studio if the price and interior quality match.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, in that case I think Evolve Champions would be a really good choice. I’ll set them up for this Saturday. Does morning or afternoon work best?",,,,,
Lead,"Afternoon 3-3:30, I tried to set it up online. Idk if it went through",,,,,
Agent,,IMG_1800.HEIC,,,,
Agent,Just scheduled for you.,,,,,

Agent,Good luck touring today! If you have any questions or concerns along the way just call or text me.,,,,,
Lead,appreciate it,,,,,
Lead,I want to get this one,,,,,
Agent,Perfect. I’m glad you liked it. Do you have everything you need to apply?,,,,,
Lead,"I should, haven’t applied yet. 
 
 The prices he showed me, those didn’t include the discount. 
 
 I want to make sure im applying for the right price",,,,,
Agent,Okay. There’s only 1 A1 left at the price. I’d definitely encourage you to apply today. If that one gets taken prices jump up to the $1200’s,,,,,
Lead,Ahhh He told me no more A1s,,,,,
Agent,Still showing one on the website. Possible someone applied and got denied. If he said that I’d say you should apply asap,,,,,
Lead,"Ok I’ll apply asap for the A1. During the application process, how can I confirm the discount?",,,,,
Agent,The discount is a given. It’ll be shown on your lease. You can wait to confirm via email but that might be a risk given that’s the last unit and it’s Saturday. Most applications get put in over the weekend.,,,,,

Agent,"Okay, will do",,,,,
Lead,"Hey I got appetite the apartment, I want to make sure you’re squared away on your end, also they didn’t give me the $957 base rent",,,,,
Agent,You saying you got approved? And base rent you’ll see doesn’t change. The special brings it down to that amount when you prorate the special,,,,,
Lead,,IMG_1576.jpeg,,,,
Lead,Yes I’m approved,,,,,

,,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Sterling! It’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment! Just a couple questions so I know exactly what you’re looking for…
 
 What areas/neighborhoods do you want to live?",,,,,
Lead,Hey I just wanna be more in the Downtown Houston area. I currently have a house in Humble. Ima a music executive and I’m always out in the city clubbing and that 35 minute drive back when you drunk and high is a huge risk.,,,,,
Lead,So I want a extra spot like a high rise in the city,,,,,
Agent,Got you. I got budget at $2700 for 2 bedrooms. Is budget flexible or firm? And are you open to 1 bedrooms also or need the 2nd room?,,,,,
Lead,Okay that’s fine but what’s the price of a 1 bed room. And do they have a 1bed 1.5 bath?,,,,,
Agent,Some will have 1bed/1.5bath. I just wanted to know if you’re open to 1 beds as well as 2 beds. You’ll have a lot more options for Highrises if you do a 1 bedroom and generally can have a bigger more open living space.,,,,,
Agent,How soon are you trying to move?,,,,,
Lead,Okay well we can do a 1 bed 1.5 bath if there’s gonna be more living and dining space,,,,,
Lead,And I’m looking for new years,,,,,
Lead,I just wanna know the budget now because when I move in I’m paying 4 months rent upfront,,,,,
Agent,"Okay so we can only see availability about 60 days in advance. That’s when 60 day notices will be in from current renters. For a January 1st move date we’ll want to start searching around Nov 1st. 
 
 If you start touring now and don’t apply until November, when there is January availability, you won’t be eligible for look & lease specials. 
 
 I recommend just having a set budget, whatever it is just a number you definitely don’t want to go over and when we search I’ll use that as a benchmark and look for everything lower, 1 & 2 bedrooms. But we should definitely get started late Oct/early Nov. You’ll thank me for it I promise. That sound good?",,,,,
Lead,Okay bet yeah that’s sounds good,,,,,
Agent,"Bet, I’ll reach out toward the end of October",,,,,
Lead,Perfect,,,,,
Agent,,Audio Message.caf,,,,
Lead,Okay awesome yes I’m still interested. When can we look at some properties?,,,,,
Agent,"Perfect, we can start looking asap. What budget do you need to stay under?",,,,,
Lead,3500 or less. I’ve been looking. I really wanna see Drewery Place on Fannin they are so hard to get into just the view they stay super booked,,,,,
Agent,Can you go Thursday at 10:30am or 1:30pm?,,,,,
Lead,That’s my birthday Halloween and I’m having a big 30th birthday party that day so I can’t,,,,,
Lead,Maybe the 2nd that Saturday,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, happy early Bday man",,,,,
Lead,Thanks bro,,,,,
Agent,Sat is booked. Can you do Monday the 4th?,,,,,
Agent,Reacted 💪🏼 to “Thanks bro ”,,,,,
Lead,I can really only do weekends because my partner works 7am-7:00pm Monday-Friday.,,,,,
Lead,Unless he takes off a day during the week. Something he takes Wednesdays off,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, there’s an open slot tomorrow at 10:30am. Or we can schedule for next Wednesday or next Saturday the 9th?",,,,,

Lead,I really only liked the first one we went to. But the plan that I think will work best they didn’t have one to show,,,,,
Lead,Unfortunately,,,,,
Agent,,IMG_1903.MOV,,,,
Agent,Is it the 2 story?,,,,,
Lead,No I liked it but I didn’t like the bedroom had no door or wall,,,,,
Lead,It was a 2/2 but she said she didn’t have one to show she just showed me a video,,,,,
Agent,Got you. We can plan to have one more weekend of tours as I look for more deals that become available. I know you were looking to move around the new year. Is that still the case?,,,,,
Lead,"Yes we can do another weekend, and honestly at this point it may be February. Ima Artist and Music Executive so I’m traveling more on the road I didn’t think I would be this month and next month but they making me release a new record and got me on promo hitting different cities",,,,,
Lead,Maybe even march at the absolute worst. I drop the record End of January,,,,,
Agent,Okay got it. It’ll be up to you. I’m not sure if you’ll want to worry about moving once you drop your record and start moving around so much. Either way we’ll see what we can do do find the right spot. I’ll even look for Feb/March availability so you can at least lock down your unit now and know where you’ll be moving then,,,,,
Lead,Okay that’ll be perfect,,,,,
Lead,I’ll even extend the search to montrose/ third ward area if they have any. Allen PKWY even!,,,,,
Agent,Got it!,,,,,
Lead,So I guess we can do another 2-4 if you can schedule it. I really do appreciate you bro.,,,,,

Lead,We didn’t get to see the last one because they didn’t have anything to show,,,,,
Lead,We like crimson but there’s literally no views at all. Everything is on the lower level and nothing to see,,,,,
Lead,Allure is super outdated,,,,,
Lead,Fourth isn’t a highrise and we hate the layout and also no views at all,,,,,
Lead,Parkside was coo but we can get the same thing cheaper at Camden downtown,,,,,
Lead,Madera was like $4.2k for a 2 bedroom with no view at all.,,,,,

 What areas or neighborhoods are you considering?",,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti! Thank you for your help! I’m thinking spring branch, west university place, the heights, etc",,,,,
Lead,I’m open to areas but I don’t want to be super far from Downtown. So areas like Katy and Woodlands are too far for me,,,,,
Lead,I just want to be in a safe area since I’m a single woman living alone.,,,,,
Agent,Got it! Do you have a lease ending soon or is your move date open?,,,,,
Lead,I can be a little flexible like 1 week timeframe,,,,,
Agent,So when are you looking to move? In the next week?,,,,,
Lead,No sorry 12/1! I thought I wrote it in the inquiry when I first emailed,,,,,
Lead,I’m going to be flying into Houston 10/30-11/2 to view apartments. I currently live in Florida,,,,,

 For your budget of $1400. Is that absolutely max or are you flexible at all?",,,,,
Lead,"I’m hoping to stay around that $1400 base rent. A little more would be fine but I’m going off base rent because I know most complexes will charge extra fees for valet trash, packages etc",,,,,
Agent,No problem. Anything else you want to share before I search that would make the perfect apartment for you?,,,,,
Lead,Has to have in unit washer and dryer and Gym!,,,,,
Agent,Okay! I’ll send some options later today and we’ll start to narrow down your favorites for when you visit 👍🏼,,,,,

Lead,Thank you! The west over apartments I don’t see the special listed on their site. Is that one where you’d have to go with me so I can get the special?,,,,,
Agent,,Screenshot 2024-10-15 at 2.04.33 PM.jpeg,,,,
Agent,"Of course! It shows as a pop-up. No, I don’t have to be there for Westover, I would just need to send your guest card to the leasing office before you show up to tour",,,,,
Agent,Have you decided on which apts you want to tour?,,,,,
Lead,Yes stadia med main and flats at west Alabama but I don’t see that they have any apartments available,,,,,
Lead,This one as well!,,,,,
Agent,Good morning! It looks like the units in price range at Flats at west Alabama were leased. I’ll keep an eye on them to see if prices drop.,,,,,
Agent,We can definitely have Stadia Med main and Resia Ten Oaks on the schedule for when you visit!,,,,,
Lead,Okay great!,,,,,

Lead,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBeYOEtuDs4/?igsh=MTF3YW1yaWphMm9nNg==,,,,,
Agent,Hey Cristal! These are Lenox Grand West in Katy,,,,,
Agent,I’m going to update your portal tonight and we can solidify your tours for your visit this week!,,,,,
Agent,"Good evening Cristal, I just emailed you another list. 
 
 Same as last time, I added options up to $1500. Many of which are running specials that will bring rent below $1400 per month. 
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling
 
 Let me know all you’ll want to tour ideally in the next 24 hours along and I’ll set them up!",,,,,
Agent,"Hey Cristal, do you have your list of apartments you’re wanting to tour on your visit?",,,,,
Lead,Yes stadia med main and evolve champions,,,,,
Lead,I also found Caroline at memorial and memorial west but not sure if you work with them,,,,,
Lead,I do like resiq but I see that it’s going for $1550+ base rent. Do you know if the 2 month free special is upfront or can it be prorated?,,,,,
Agent,Liked “Yes stadia med main and evolve champions ”,,,,,
Agent,I can definitely have them scheduled. For Caroline Memorial the floor plans within budget are income restricted so look at the photo and let me know if you would qualify. Any floorplan with a “P” is restricted,,,,,
Agent,,IMG_1832.PNG,,,,
Agent,"And Resia I believe you’ll get the special starting on the 2nd month. It won’t be prorated, specials are rarely prorated in Houston but you will always have the option to self-prorate",,,,,
Agent,There’s also a brand new apartment called Broadstone Amelia you may want to see. 1 bedrooms for $1482 + 2 months free = $1254/mo self prorated,,,,,
Agent,Broadstoneamelia.com,,,,,
Lead,Yeah the P8,,,,,
Lead,I called Amelia this morning actually but they said the 1 bedroom that is atleast 700 sq feet is going for $1580,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, to be sure these are the four you need tours scheduled for?
 
 Stadia med main
 Evolve Champions
 Memorial West
 Caroline at Memorial",,,,,
Agent,Let me know so I can schedule. One more I’d recommend is Avasa Spring Branch. 1 bedroom 709sqft is $1499 + 6 weeks free. Cheaper than the units at Caroline at Memorial are so figured you may be interested,,,,,
Lead,"Yes just those , I saw Avasa on the list and it looks nice but few recent reviews talking about infestations and rats",,,,,
Agent,"Got it. Mmm those are really recent, I didn’t see those before thanks for pointing out!",,,,,
Agent,Please let me know what time you’ll be in on Wednesday and if you’d like to start touring straight away or begin Thursday morning,,,,,

Agent,"Hey Courtney! it’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment. Just a couple details so I can find exactly what you’re looking for!
 
 Do you have a lease ending soon or is your move date open and flexible?",,,,,
Lead,Hi Ashanti ! My current lease is ending December 17. I was looking for maybe the week before that or Dec 16. since the holiday will be rolling out around then and I will be out of town.,,,,,
Agent,"Got it! Thanks for being so detailed on location. 
 
 I have your price for 2 bedrooms at $1800. Is price flexible at all or is $1800 absolute max for rent?",,,,,
Lead,it’s definitely flexible if the apartment is worth it if that makes sense.,,,,,
Lead,but i trust your judgement the location is my main concern at the moment.,,,,,
Agent,"Got it. Is there a cut off price that I should avoid sending deals priced at?
 
 And any other building or apartment unit details you want to share that would make your new place perfect?",,,,,
Lead,maybe anything up to $2000 i guess would be the cut off.,,,,,
Lead,as far as details umm i definitely want something with a parking garage i think they call it detached garages.,,,,,
Lead,other than that i’m pretty open about the specifics,,,,,
Lead,"i just want to be somewhere safe, nice and a little closer to work to make my commute less.",,,,,
Lead,i will say i do work in 77057 Williams Towers area incase you may have any options there. i’m still new to htx. it’s only been a year for me so im still getting used to the areas and what’s what.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay, got it. I’ll send some options in a bit and we’ll start getting you scheduled for some tours 👍🏼",,,,,

Agent,"Also there are a few changes that have affected availability for your December time frame and/or buildings I wanted to point out… 
 
 Define Living at Brittmoore - looks like the one availability close to your date is a flourish floor plan 2bed/2bath available Nov15 for $1990. Unit #1360. See how flexible they can be with move in dates. 
 
 Citadel Apartments - I think your best option is a B4 floorplan. Unit 443 for $2010 available Nov 29. Don’t let them miss out on showing you this floorplan. 
 
 Skyhouse River Oaks - I’m only seeing their best price now being $2130 for a 2 bedroom and nothing available in December any longer. It’s up to you if you want to keep the tour incase something opens up that fits your criteria
 
 *Other tours have multiple options to choose from for December",,,,,

Agent,Sounds perfect!,,,,,
Agent,Good morning! ☀️ I hope tours went well this weekend. Checking in to see if you had any favorites so far,,,,,
Lead,"good morning ! thank you for checking in. umm skyhouse was an immediate no 😂 but we did like define living, timbergrove and the west over at west branch. i do have some other stuff scheduled for this weekend apart from the last two we have. after that i’m hoping to narrow down on having a top three and go from there.",,,,,
Agent,"Of course. Lol got you, any particular reason they’re so out of the question?",,,,,
Agent,And okay sounds good. Throughout the week I may send you a couple more to consider. What other buildings did you schedule?,,,,,
Lead,it was just skyhouse that was terrible we didn’t really like the set up and off the walk in it was ghetto 😂 i’m sorry i know things are crazy all over but it was a hot mess. but the layout was not so great the kitchen was very small and the ceilings looked undone but i guess that’s the buildings style,,,,,
Lead,"other than that the other options were good timbergrove , westover and define were our favs from there only thing was define doesn’t have any availability for the time of december so we’d have to keep a look out",,,,,
Lead,i have to double check but i believe it was modera and broadstone i don’t remember the names exactly don’t quote me lol,,,,,
Agent,Lol got you! You know some people just loveee Highrises so I guess always good to see to know all your options,,,,,
Agent,Liked “other than that the other options were good timber…”,,,,,
Agent,"Probably Modera Garden Oaks. I thought it was odd you didn’t choose to see them from your list. I think you’ll love them! 
 
 The others may be Broadstone Amelia and/or Broadstone Amarra? Amelia just opened and Amarra won’t be open for your move date. They’re brand new but note that no units have balconies",,,,,
Lead,true but that high rise was not giving and their professionalism was shot. whoever was at the front was upset we interrupted her lunch like girl you’re sitting in the front eating at the check in desk go in the lounge or something idk 😂😂,,,,,
Lead,you know i think i overlooked modera idk why i didn’t add it either 😂 i think it’s amelia yes ! okay noted !,,,,,
Lead,i do appreciate your help i’ll lyk how saturday goes and hopefully we’ll have a top 3-4 list from there.,,,,,

Lead,will do !,,,,,
Agent,Loved “will do ! ”,,,,,
Agent,Hey Courtney! Have you finalized times for the Modera and Broadstone tours tomorrow?,,,,,
Lead,"hey ashanti ! sorry for the delay in response, work was very busy today. but the person i’m rooming with actually had reached out to another locator for those so they were finalized through them i’m assuming.",,,,,
Agent,Hey good morning Courtney!☀️In all fairness of all the work we’ve done together I truly hope you choose to use me as your referral wherever you end up. Good luck touring today! Please let me know your thoughts after you’ve seen all the options,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Hey good morning Courtney!☀️In all fairness of all…”,,,,,

Agent,Loved “this is partially why i was trying to go solo lol.…”,,,,,

Lead,i gotchu thank you 😊,,,,,
Agent,Loved “i gotchu thank you 😊 ”,,,,,
Agent,Good morning!☀️How did yours go this weekend? Any final decisions between all the options?,,,,,
Lead,good morning ! umm we ended up not making it to lenox oaks bc vibe didn’t see us until like forty minutes after our scheduled time due to move ins. the lady i spoke with at lenox oaks wasn’t understanding and i wasn’t trying to argue so i left it even tho we were behind ten minutes…,,,,,
Lead,but overall everything was goood i think we’ve narrowed down on two it’s just been a busy weekend so we’re going to finalize in a few days and hopefully send an application.,,,,,
Agent,"Dang, I’m sorry to hear that. Sucks when apartments ruin the experience from the jump",,,,,
Agent,"Okay that’s good, let me know if there’s anything I can do to help with any decision making!",,,,,

Agent,Pleasure is mine!,,,,,
Agent,Hey good afternoon Courtney. Wanted to follow up and make sure you’re still all on track. Any questions you need answered for the apts you’re choosing between?,,,,,
Lead,"good afternoon , so i’m actually back at square one lol. the person i room with doesn’t want me to “have the better room” 😂 a joke i know right ? but modera was the choice but since the space is uneven we’ll be looking some more.",,,,,
Lead,but honestly this has become annoying so i just might be going with plan b of what i wanted to do originally which was solo.,,,,,
Lead,i feel like i’ve wasted your time. so i do apologize!,,,,,
Agent,"Lol oh no! Not a problem though, do you want to start looking for both? 2 beds for the both of you and 1 bedrooms for yourself?
 
 Oh don’t even think about that lol. So much can happen when looking for apartments. I’m just here to try and find the best place for w.e the circumstances are",,,,,
Lead,"we could , i was looking at timbergrove again. 
 
 i truly appreciate your help. i hate to be so negative it’s just been overwhelming and i have a lot on my plate rn. ive only been out here a year so it would make sense to stay a pair but for all this i can’t with the unnecessary combat. i don’t mind compromising tho.",,,,,
Lead,i’ll look at your list again and see.,,,,,
Agent,"Okay. I’ll take another look today & tomorrow. I’m sorry, definitely can be so overwhelming",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, what budget do you want to stay under if you’re solo?",,,,,
Lead,Loved “Okay. I’ll take another look today & tomorrow. I’m…”,,,,,
Lead,mmmm for the areas i’ve been looking in what do the prices of one beds or studios range from ?,,,,,
Lead,maybe $1200-1300,,,,,
Lead,but i feel like that’s low,,,,,
Agent,It depends. So you’re open to studios as well? How big do you need the apartment to be?,,,,,
Agent,At that price you might be eligible for some of the income restricted apartments in the city which can be brand new. Whats your monthly gross income?,,,,,
Lead,yeah timbergrove had a nice studio when i was there that’s def an option. it was almost like a one bedroom in my opinion,,,,,
Lead,let me look at the #s hold on,,,,,
Lead,okay my monthly gross is about $2300,,,,,
Lead,i have seen some nice essential housing options,,,,,
Agent,Okay. I’ll have to look into it. Essential housing will still require that you make 2.5x or 3x the rent so the most you’d get approved for alone is around $900,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Courtney, I haven’t come across essential housing options you’d be approved for on your own. Are you still thinking about moving solo?",,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Agent,"Hey Breona, It’s Ashanti with Apt Amigo. Thanks for submitting your form, I’m happy to help you find your next apartment!
 
 What areas/neighborhoods are you looking to live?",,,,,
Lead,Um I just wanted to know the name of that apartment complex you posted,,,,,
Agent,So not looking to move? Are you window shopping for a future date?,,,,,
Lead,Well my lease ends in November so I’m trying to weigh my options I really liked that one so I wanted to look at reviews,,,,,
Lead,If you don’t want to give me the name of the complex it’s fine lol just wondering,,,,,
Agent,,Audio Message.caf,,,,
Lead,,Audio Message.caf,,,,
Agent,Loved an audio message,,,,,
Agent,Sounds good!,,,,,
Lead,"Hi Ashanti, hope all is well with you. My lease ends November 30th, I’m looking for a 1 bed 1 bath, potentially 1 bed room with a den , and what matters most to me is how it looks, I like a modern look tbh. I like black cabinet handles, black door knobs, I like the black and white look. Definitely need a double sided fridge, balcony, stand up shower, with a tub attached (if possible) .. I like quiet areas like Katy, woodlands, cypress etc but I wouldn’t mind trying something new as long as the apartment doesn’t have bug infestations, a lot of breaking in cars, etc. (preferably a gated community or a community with a garage) my price range is 1400-1700$ I’m also willing to compromise just depends on what",,,,,
Lead,"I’m currently at Lenox grand west in Katy which I love so very much, I’m trying to weigh my options to see if there’s something better for what I’m paying so I can know if I want to renew or move",,,,,

Agent,…and the post is Drewery Place,,,,,
Lead,I’m paying 1634$ 861sqft,,,,,
Lead,With one month free so I’m technically paying 1500$ plus utilities and pet rent which all equals 1605$ a month,,,,,

Lead,"Perfect. My hope would be to design across Texas. 
 
 Here’s the firm information",,,,,
Agent,"Perfect, just followed!",,,,,
Agent,Hey Ashley! I hope all is well. How has the living experience been since move in?,,,,,
Lead,"Here I come mad late lol what’s going on Ashanti! Hope you’re well. The building is solid. Couple hiccups but nothing crazy. 
 
 J and I are getting a divorce so I’m actually entertaining other apatin the area around 2bds top floor under the $2,600 rate we currently have",,,,,
Agent,"Lol it’s okay. Thank you, I hope you are too. Okay, happy to hear it’s been altogether well. 
 
 I’m sorry to hear about you and J. Is a move imminent or just a thought for now?",,,,,
Lead,"Imminent, just spoke with the leasing office to ask if I moved to a smaller unit would that be me breaking the lease.",,,,,
Lead,"They said yes. So now I’m curious about other places in the area. 
 
 Thanks, but I’m not sorry.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, no worries. So you’re looking for 2 bedrooms top floor in the same area? What budget do you need to stay under?",,,,,
Lead,"I’d love to stay under 2,300",,,,,
Agent,"Okay got it. Will J be keeping the current apartment to avoid the broken lease? That’s always a concern of mine, because broken leases can be a lot more impactful in the future than many realize",,,,,
Lead,"Honestly he doesn’t know I’m apartment searching. And I’d like to keep it that way. If I stay in the building I’d want him to leave. 
 
 If I leave the building he’s likely stay.",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, no problem. Whats your email? I’ll start searching now and send you some options via email",,,,,
Lead,Trybiancaplease@gmail.com,,,,,
Agent,Liked “Trybiancaplease@gmail.com”,,,,,
Agent,"Just emailed you some options
 
 Most of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling. 
 
 Let me know which you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up for a time convenient for you",,,,,
Lead,Okay thank you boss,,,,,
Agent,Pleasure is mine,,,,,
Lead,Morning! I’m going to go into an another unit in the building. How do I give you locator credit?,,,,,

Lead,"Interested in and Must Haves:

 1. In unit Washer & Dryer

 Optional would be:

 2. Gym (24 hours)
 3. Carpet Throughout",,,,,
Lead,Loved “Got it! Will you be visiting too tour apartments i…”,,,,,
Lead,I plan on doing in person visits☺️,,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Interested in and Must Haves:
 
 Studio/Convertible …”",,,,,
Agent,Perfect! Do you have dates scheduled yet?,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Perfect! Do you have dates scheduled yet?”,,,,,
Lead,Not yet! But I’m trying my best to stay within a certain region perhaps when it comes to doing apartment tours because Houston I’m learning is so huge!,,,,,
Lead,I think I can consider places that are 45 minutes to an hour away from each other in terms of seeing places in person☺️✅,,,,,
Lead,Plus the higher the google reviews the better🤞🏾☺️,,,,,
Agent,"Got it! And yes Houston is a BIG city. I’ll make sure to show you the right places to stay within budget. At $1100 rent you will need to show verifiable income of $3300 per month, is that doable?
 
 Also is $1100 absolute max or do you have some flexibility?",,,,,
Lead,"Understood and thank you!
 Yes that’s doable and yes, I have some flexibility as well✅☺️",,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Understood and thank you!
 Yes that’s doable and ye…”",,,,,
Agent,"Okay, what’s the max rent you’d be comfortable paying?",,,,,
Lead,Max 1300,,,,,
Lead,Willing to give a little wiggle over 1300 but not too much🤞🏾🙏🏽,,,,,
Agent,"Got it! As you might already know, the best time to start looking is within 60 days of moving, so 60 day notices are in from renters across the city. And when you’re able to tour, since prices and availability change so often. 
 
 Prices change daily so I’ll want to get you a list of your best options option once you have your dates set to visit. That way there won’t be such big changes from now to when you’re actually able to tour.",,,,,
Agent,Our best plan is: When you schedule your visit just let me know what the dates are and I will send your best options and coordinate your tours to already be set when you arrive! That sound okay?,,,,,
Lead,That sounds great! and I plan on visiting October 23rd through the 26th☺️✅,,,,,
Agent,Okay perfect! Let me know once you’ve scheduled your trip and we’ll get started. We’ll find the perfect place! 🙌🏼,,,,,
Lead,"Right now, I am in renting a room in the house for $900 a month and that includes everything but I need my privacy lol and I think this is definitely a great blessing. Coming up to be moving to Houston! Thank you again for helping me!",,,,,
Agent,"Loved “Right now, I am in renting a room in the house for…”",,,,,
Agent,It’s my pleasure to help! I’m looking forward to working together 🙂,,,,,
Lead,"Yes, I am scheduled to travel Wednesday, October 23 until Saturday, October 26",,,,,
Lead,Loved “It’s my pleasure to help! I’m looking forward to w…”,,,,,
Lead,Thank you and same here!☺️✅,,,,,
Agent,"Emphasized “Yes, I am scheduled to travel Wednesday, October …”",,,,,
Agent,"Oh, got it! I’ll send some options later today and we’ll start to narrow down 👌🏼",,,,,
Lead,"Reacted 👌🏾 to “Oh, got it! I’ll send some options later today and…”",,,,,
Lead,Awesome! Thank you!,,,,,
Agent,My pleasure!,,,,,
Agent,"I just emailed your list!
 
 Some require me to escort you to get credit + a lot of the properties require your Locator to set up your appt - so please let me take care of all scheduling 👍🏽
 
 Prices you see are without any applicable specials. I added only top floor (besides The Oliver) which is a client favorite building in the city. You can search the portal yourself for deals also if you think anything was missed!
 
 Let me know the top 3-5 you want to tour ideally in the next 24-48 hours and I’ll set them up for when you visit!",,,,,
Agent,"Also you’ll be getting a $200 cash rebate or free move (your choice). 
 
 And I can only do that if you list me as your referral correctly when you tour and apply - If you know what to look for at time of application, that’s perfect. If not, just reach out before you start an app and I’ll guide you!",,,,,
Lead,"Loved “I just emailed your list!
 
 Some require me to esc…”",,,,,
Lead,"How does a $200 rebate or free move work? Also, thank you so much for emailing me the list. I will be checking that in a little bit!",,,,,
Agent,"The free move is a free 2 hour move. Honestly, I’d recommend the $200 rebate because the move usually never turns out to be free. You’ll still need to pay a move deposit and sometimes you just don’t get the full value. The $200 rebate is cash sent via Zelle and paid out the same day I’m paid out 👍🏼",,,,,
Lead,"I’m so sorry I’m confused… I’m not sure if this is the best fit for me..😩
 
 I just arrived a house fire before renting this room and so my money is extremely tight and I don’t want to pay to move into a place if that makes sense right now my expenses are higher than I would like them to be because I’m starting over",,,,,
Agent,"I’m confused myself. Are you saying you’ll no longer be moving to Houston? 
 
 I’m really sorry to hear you were involved in a house fire. The $200 is paid to you for working with us. Our services are free to you",,,,,
Lead,"OK, thank you so much for the clarification. I thought I had to pay and got really worried lol I didn’t know that I would get paid for working with you guys. That’s such a blessing! Do you guys do this in the form of a Zelle payment or do you send out a paper check? Again, thank you so much for helping me with this process of searching!☺️🏡",,,,,
Agent,Absolutely! It will be a Zelle payment,,,,,
Lead,Loved “Absolutely! It will be a Zelle payment ”,,,,,
Lead,Awesome thank you so much again!🏡🙏🏽☺️,,,,,
